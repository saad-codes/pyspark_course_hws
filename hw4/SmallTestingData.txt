federal court of australia act 1976  s 24.migrationprocedureThis is a purported appeal from a decision of a Federal Magistrate.The Magistrate made an order dismissing an application under s 476 of the Migration Act 1958  ('the Act').The application to the Federal Magistrates Court under s 476 of the Act was supported by an affidavit as required by r 44.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 and it came before the Magistrate on a first court date on 30 January 2006.At that time, it was not clear to the Magistrate that the application disclosed an arguable case and, accordingly, he listed the matter for a hearing under r 44.12 so that he could determine whether the application raised an arguable case.He gave the applicant the opportunity to amend her application and to file further affidavits.No further affidavits were filed.Two amended applications were filed, but it is unnecessary for me to set out the details of those applications.The hearing under r 44.12 took place on 3 March 2006.The Magistrate concluded that the application failed to disclose an arguable case within r 44.12 and, accordingly, he dismissed it.On 23 March 2006 the applicant filed a notice of appeal from the decision in this Court.Rule 44.12 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 makes it clear that an order for dismissal under paragraph  is an interlocutory order.The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs filed a notice of objection to competency of the appeal and submits that the appeal is not competent in the absence of a grant of leave to appeal.In my opinion, that submission is correct.The order made by the Magistrate is interlocutory, and under s 24 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 , leave to appeal is required.The Minister does not object to me treating the purported notice of appeal as an application for leave to appeal, and I think that that is the appropriate course.The test for granting leave to appeal is well known and I will not repeat it: Decor Corporation v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 399-400.The applicant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China, and she arrived in Australia on 15 March 2005.On 26 April 2005, she lodged an application for a protection (Class XA) visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs under the Act.On 5 August 2005, a delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs refused to grant a protection visa.On 6 September 2005, the applicant applied to the Refugee Review Tribunal for a review of that decision.The applicant was born on 6 March 1957 and she claims that she is one of the leaders of Falon Gong in Shanghai, China.She claims that the Chinese authorities regard Falon Gong as an illegal organisation.She claims that she helped to organise a number of activities related to Falon Gong.She claims that she was warned about her involvement in Falon Gong by the local police and local government.She claims that in April 2001, she was put into detention for one month.She claims that in October 2002, she was ordered to attend a 're-education' centre for two months.She claims that in May 2003, she was imprisoned for one week because an unidentified person told the police that she practised Falon Gong every day.On 28 September 2005, the Tribunal wrote to the applicant and advised her that it had considered the material before it in relation to the application, but was unable to make a decision in her favour on that information alone.The applicant was invited to attend a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence and present arguments in support of her claims.She was told that if she did not attend the hearing and if the Tribunal did not postpone the hearing, then the Tribunal could make a decision on her case without further notice.She was advised that the proposed hearing would take place on 28 October 2005.The applicant did not attend the proposed hearing of the Tribunal.On 31 October 2005, she was advised that the Tribunal had made a decision, and that it would hand down its decision on 22 November 2005.The Tribunal decided to affirm the decision of the delegate of the Minister.In the course of its reasons, the Tribunal said: Generally, where broad allegations are made, the Tribunal hearing is an opportunity for the Tribunal to gather detail about the claims with the applicant.The applicant has been put on notice by the Tribunal that it is unable to make a favourable decision on the information before it but has not provided any further information in support of her claims despite ample opportunity to do so.Nor has she given the Tribunal the opportunity to explore aspects of her claims with her.A number of relevant questions are therefore left unanswered.At hearing, for example, I would have wanted to satisfy myself that the applicant is indeed a genuine Falon Gong practitioner.I have been unable to do that.As to her claims to have been detained at various times, I would have wanted to hear more details about the circumstances to satisfy myself that that really occurred.I have been unable to do that.Finally, I would have wanted to know why she did not leave China for nearly two years after her last detention.The applicant raised two main points before the Magistrate.First, she asserted that the Tribunal did not comply with its obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the applicant to appear before the Tribunal to give evidence and present arguments.Secondly, she asserted that the Tribunal did not comply with its obligation under s 424A of the Act, in that it did not give her particulars of relevant information.The specific information she asserted that the Tribunal was obliged to disclose was the fact that it would draw an adverse inference against her by reason of the fact that she did not leave China for nearly two years after her last detention.The Magistrate rejected both of these grounds.In essence, the applicant submitted that he erred in doing so.As to the first ground, the Magistrate made findings of fact which establish that the Tribunal met its obligation under s 425 of the Act to invite the applicant to a hearing and that the Tribunal was entitled to proceed in the absence of the applicant when she failed to appear at the time and place fixed for the hearing.The applicant did not identify any error in relation to those findings.As to the second ground, the Magistrate rejected the challenge of the Tribunal's approach for a number of reasons.First, he concluded that all the Tribunal member was saying was that that was an issue that he would like to have explored with the applicant and that that was not an error.Secondly, the comment was based on information provided by the applicant, and, accordingly, did not need to be disclosed by reason of the provisions of s 424A of the Act.Thirdly, the Magistrate said that the information did not need to be disclosed because it was the insufficiency of the information that was determinative and not any particular information contained in the visa application.The Magistrate referred to the decision in SZBCS v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1457.I agree with each of the reasons identified by the Magistrate.His conclusions are supported by authority, including VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 per Finn and Stone JJ at 476-477, at [24] and SZCIA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 238.Neither ground of challenge is arguable and, in those circumstances, the application for leave to appeal must be dismissed with costs.I will hear the parties as to whether I should order costs in a fixed amount pursuant to O 62 r 4 of the Federal Court Rules .</doc>

aside.bankruptcyThis is an application to set aside Bankruptcy Notice 190 of 2005 ("the Notice") issued to the applicant ("Genovese") under the Bankruptcy Act 1966  ("the Act ") by the Official Receiver for the Bankruptcy District of Western Australia on 13 June 2005 at the request of the respondent ("BGC").The Notice is the fourth such notice to be issued to Genovese at BGC's request based on a judgment obtained by BGC against Genovese in the Local Court of Western Australia on 17 October 2003.Judgment was entered by consent for a sum of $10,000 and costs to be taxed.Those costs were taxed and certified on 23 December 2003 in a sum of $11,432.94.Prior to 17 October 2003 other orders for costs had been made in the proceeding in BGC's favour namely, on 28 February 2003, 15 April 2003 and 9 June 2003.On 22 May 2003 costs were taxed pursuant to the orders made on 28 February and 15 April 2003 and certified by the Taxing Officer in a sum of $2,010.42.That sum was duly paid by Genovese.In respect of the order for costs made on 9 June 2003 taxed costs were certified on 29 October 2003 in a sum of $4,979.33.The first bankruptcy notice, issued on 12 March 2004, was set aside by consent.The second and third bankruptcy notices were issued on 21 April 2004 and 8 September 2004 respectively.BGC elected not to proceed on the second notice and the third notice was set aside by an order made by a judge of this Court (Lander J) on 11 March 2005 on appeal from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court.The reasons for decision of his Honour set out the history of the matter in detail.See: Genovese v BGC Construction Pty Ltd (2005) 215 ALR 440).An unresolved issue that arose out of the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court and not dealt with in the appeal is whether a further sum of $3,000 was paid to BGC by Genovese on 30 April 2004 in reduction of the judgment entered on 17 October 2003 being a sum not accounted for in the Notice.See: Genovese v Homestyle Pty Ltd [2004] FMCA 673 at [33] ).On 25 July 2005 Genovese filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking an order that the Notice be set aside.On 21 September 2005 the Federal Magistrates Court ordered that the application be transferred to this Court by reason of the complexity of the issues raised.Upon transfer of the matter the Court determined pursuant to Order 80 of the Rules of the Federal Court that it was appropriate that the Registrar be directed to obtain pro bono legal representation for Genovese in order that the Court may be assisted by submissions from counsel for each party.Up to that point Genovese had been unrepresented.As far as the instant matter is concerned s 40 of the Act provides that a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy if a creditor who has obtained against the debtor a final judgment or final order, the execution of which has not been stayed, has served on the debtor a bankruptcy notice under the Act requiring the debtor to pay the judgment debt and the debtor does not, within the time specified in the notice, comply with the requirements of the notice.Section 41 states that an Official Receiver may issue a bankruptcy notice on the application of a creditor who has obtained against a debtor a final judgment or final order (or two or more final judgments or final orders) in an amount of at least $2,000.Section 41 stipulates that the notice must be in the form prescribed by the Bankruptcy Regulations 1966  ("the Regulations").Regulation 4.02 provides that Form 1 in Schedule 1 of the Regulations is the prescribed form.Regulation 4.02 also states that a bankruptcy notice must follow Form 1 in respect of its format --- "for example, bold or italic typeface, underlining and notes".Item 1 of Form 1 gives notice to a debtor that the creditor claims that the debtor owes the creditor a debt in a specified amount arising under a judgment and states that details of the amount of the debt are shown in the Schedule to the Form.The Schedule provides for details of the amount owing to the creditor by the debtor under judgments or orders to be inserted.Item 2 of Form 1 states that "a copy" of the judgments or orders "relied upon" by the creditor is attached to the notice.Failure to attach a copy of a judgment or order relied upon is a failure to comply with s 41 and represents a fundamental defect in the notice and invalidates it.See: The Australian Steel Company (Operations) Pty Ltd v Lewis [2000] FCA 1915 ; (2000) 109 FCR 33; Commonwealth Bank v Horvath (Junior) (1999) 161 ALR 441).In relevant respects the Schedule to Form 1 reads as follows: Column 1 Column 2 1 Amount of judgments or orders plus 2 Legal costs if ordered to be paid and a specific amount was not included in the judgments or orders (see Note 1 , below) plus 3 If claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, interest accrued since the date of judgments or orders (see Note 2 , below) Subtotal less 5 Payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders Total debt owing NB: Amounts, where applicable, are to be inserted in column 2)Note 1 : Legal costs (item 2 of the Schedule)If legal costs are being claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, a certificate of taxed or assessed costs in support of the amount claimed must be attached to this Bankruptcy Notice.The particulars inserted in the Schedule to the Notice were as follows: Column 1 Column 2 Amount of judgments or orders $28,422.69 plus 2 Legal costs if ordered to be paid and a specific amount was not included in the judgments or orders (see Note 1 , below) plus 3 If claimed in this Bankruptcy Notice, interest accrued since the date of judgments or orders (see Note 2 , below) NIL Subtotal $28,422.69 less 5 Payments made and/or credits allowed since date of judgments or orders $ 2,010.40 Total debt owing $26,412.29 " When the matter came on for hearing on 15 December 2005 counsel for Genovese submitted that the Notice failed to comply with the requirements of the Act and the Regulations.Plainly the amount set out in Item 1 of the Notice and in Item 1 of the Schedule to the Notice was a composite sum based on several judgments or orders.Whether pursuant to Item 2 of the Notice BGC had to attach a copy of the costs orders made on 28 February, 15 April and 9 June 2003 is unnecessary to decide.At least pursuant to Item 2 and Note 1 of the Schedule to the Notice the certificates of the taxed costs made pursuant to those orders had to be attached.Although unnecessary to decide in the instant case it may be thought that the words of Item 2 and of Note 1 of the Schedule to the Notice make it clear that costs not fixed but ordered to be paid as part of a judgment or order must be set out in Item 2 of the Schedule and a certificate of those taxed costs attached.I note that in Stec v Orfanos [1999] FCA 457 at [17] it is suggested that it is not necessary to attach a certificate of taxed costs where a judgment recited in Item 1 of the Schedule provides for costs to be taxed.But such a conclusion would not be consistent with the words used in Item 2 of the Schedule or Note 1 and, furthermore, would fail to meet the evident purpose of a bankruptcy notice prescribed by the Act and Regulations, namely, to give a debtor notice of how the amount set out in the Notice has been calculated as the amount owing.Item 2 of the Schedule is not restricted to legal costs not included in the judgments or orders referred to in Item 1.It expressly applies to legal costs ordered to be paid where a specific amount has not been included in a judgment or order referred to in Item 1.The words of Note 1 confirm that construction.Therefore, if costs are ordered but not fixed in a judgment or order set out in Item 1 the amount of those costs as subsequently taxed or assessed must be set out in Item 2 and a certificate of the taxed or assessed costs must be attached.On the reasoning applied in Stec there would be no function for Note 1 to the Schedule to perform.The amounts due under more than one final judgment or order, including a costs order, would be aggregated in Item 1 of the Schedule and pursuant to the reasoning in Stec no amount or certificate of costs taxed pursuant to a costs order could be said to be relevant to Item 2 and Note 1 of the Schedule.In any event to comply with the requirements of the Act it was necessary for BGC to deliver to the Official Receiver for attachment to the Notice a copy of the judgment entered in the Local Court on 17 October 2003 and a copy of any other order for the payment of costs that BGC sought to have included in the Notice as the debt claimed to be due.See: Commonwealth Bank v Horvath ).The document dated 6 April 2005 attached to the Notice purported to be a certified copy of the judgment entered on 17 October 2003.It misstated the amount of that judgment debt by aggregating with that sum amounts of taxed costs that became payable under other orders.No copies of those other orders, or certificates of the costs taxed pursuant thereto, were attached to the Notice.It may be assumed that pursuant to O 23 r 6 of the Local Court Rules 1961 , BGC prepared a praecipe of the certified judgment sought to be attached to the Notice and was responsible for the misstatement in the Notice of the amount of the judgment debt entered on 17 October 2003.In light of the foregoing BGC conceded that the Notice must be set aside.It contended, however, that no costs order should be made.Counsel for Genovese submitted that costs should follow the event.The grounds of BGC's argument on costs were that BGC had incurred unnecessary expense in preparing a response to arguments foreshadowed by Genovese as an unrepresented applicant but abandoned by counsel for Genovese.Further it was submitted that the ground raised by counsel for Genovese only materialised "at the eleventh hour".Counsel for Genovese submitted that the Bankruptcy Notice was defective on its face and that the usual order for costs should be made.I am satisfied that the discretion available to the Court under s 43 of the Federal Court Act 1976  should be exercised by an order that BGC pay the costs of Genovese.BGC had four opportunities to present a bankruptcy notice for issue that complied with requirements of the Act and Regulations and failed to do so.The defect in the Notice should have been apparent to BGC at the time the Notice was presented to the Official Receiver for endorsement and issue.Whilst it was not until Genovese was represented by counsel that the ground on which the challenge to the validity of the Notice was able to be articulated on behalf of Genovese, BGC had been on notice since the filing of the application that the validity of the Notice was in issue and it could have ascertained by appropriate examination of the primary documents that the Notice was defective.By reason of the amendments made to the Act and Regulations in respect of bankruptcy notices considered and explained in Australian Steel, responsibility for the accuracy of a bankruptcy notice issued by the Official Receiver now lies with the creditor seeking the issue of the notice and not with a Registrar in Bankruptcy or an Official Receiver.It follows that a creditor requesting the issue of such a notice must exercise due care to ensure that there has been compliance with the Act and Regulations.See: Australian Steel at [53], [63]).The Notice will be set aside and BGC ordered to pay the costs of the application.</doc>

published prior to forthcoming commission hearingsinjunctionscontempt of courtOn 9 August 2006, I made an interim order on the ex parte application of the applicant, AWB Limited ('AWB'), restraining the first respondent until 4.30pm on 10 August 2006 from publishing or disclosing any of the documents referred to in exhibit JMC4 to the affidavit of Mr John Mitchell, sworn 9 August 2006 ('the documents').The documents comprise draft statements of contrition which are no longer the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege and which contain various references to legal advice obtained by AWB.AWB now applies, by notice of motion dated 10 August 2006, for a continuation of the non-publication order until the hearing or determination of this proceeding.The first respondent has informed the Court that he will abide any order of the Court, but that in the absence of a restraining order he proposes to publish the documents as they are no longer the subject of a claim for legal professional privilege.BACKGROUND On 25 May 2006, AWB supplied the documents to the Commission of Inquiry that is being conducted by the first respondent ('the Inquiry') pursuant to notices to produce issued by the first respondent.The documents had originally been withheld from production on the ground of legal professional privilege.After my decision in AWB Limited v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole [2006] FCA 571 , AWB determined that a claim for privilege could not be maintained over the documents.AWB supplied the documents to the Inquiry under cover of a letter dated 25 May 2006 which stated that it did not claim legal professional privilege over the documents.The covering letter did not make any claim that the documents should be kept confidential.In the course of proceedings before me, Mr Judd, senor counsel for AWB, confirmed that AWB does not seek to assert any claim of legal professional privilege over the documents.In correspondence and other exchanges between AWB's solicitors and the Inquiry this week, the Inquiry told AWB on several occasions that it intends to publish the documents.The most relevant exchanges are these: On 8 August 2006, the solicitor assisting the Inquiry, Mr Owbridge, wrote to the solicitors for AWB and advised that the documents would be tendered at the Inquiry on 8 or 9 August 2006.In this letter, Mr Owbridge observed that there appeared to be no commercial confidentiality claims in respect of any of the documents.AWB's solicitors immediately responded by letter dated 8 August 2006 and requested confirmation that the Inquiry would not take any action to publish any of the documents pending the determination of this proceeding.This letter appears to have crossed with an email from Mr Owbridge which stated that the documents would be published on the Inquiry's website shortly rather than later on 8 August 2006 as previously advised.Mr Mitchell then had a telephone conversation with Mr Owbridge in which Mr Mitchell asked for an opportunity to claim confidentiality and to consider any privilege issues that arise out of the production of the documents to the Inquiry.A little later that day Mr Owbridge sent an email to AWB's solicitors stating that the documents would be published at 5.00pm on 8 August 2006, pending AWB's claims for commercial confidentiality.AWB's solicitors responded by a further letter dated 8 August and asked that the documents be kept confidential and not published and advised that disclosure of those parts of the documents that referred to earlier legal advice would, if published on the website, adversely affect AWB's claims for legal professional privilege in this proceeding.The Inquiry's final letter on 8 August 2006 advised AWB's solicitors that the documents would not be published before midday on 9 August 2006.A few minutes before 4.15pm on 9 August 2006, AWB's solicitors received a letter from the solicitor assisting the Inquiry which advised that, as no sensible basis had been advanced as to why the documents should remain confidential and as no application to restrain publication had been made, the Inquiry proposed to publish the documents at 4.30pm that afternoon.The last mentioned letter led directly to AWB's ex parte application and my interim order of 9 August 2006.On 10 August 2006, the solicitors acting for the first respondent in this proceeding forwarded a letter to AWB's solicitors which advised that, while the first respondent would abide an order of the Court, his position remained that he proposed to publish the documents on the Inquiry's website as they were not the subject of any claim for legal professional privilege.The letter also advised that the Inquiry wishes to publish the documents prior to the resumption of hearings by the Inquiry so that persons given leave to appear will have a reasonable opportunity of considering the additional documentary evidence.The first respondent intends to resume public hearings on 22 August 2006.ALLEGED INTERFERENCE WITH THE COURT'S PROCESSES AWB founds its application for interlocutory relief on the contention that publication of the documents would interfere with the orderly disposition of the issues in this case, or in subsequent cases, and therefore amounts to a threatened contempt of Court.AWB submitted that one of the issues in this case is that of imputed waiver.Specifically, the issue before this Court is whether AWB has waived privilege over documents that are said to be associated with legal advices that AWB has disclosed to the Inquiry.In these circumstances, AWB submitted that the Commonwealth may wish to use the Inquiry's public dissemination of the documents to support its imputed waiver argument in this case, and that other litigants may wish to do so in subsequent cases.This Court has power under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976  to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, as the Court thinks appropriate.That power extends to the making of orders that are necessary to enable the Federal Court to exercise its jurisdiction effectively, or to prevent any abuse or frustration of, or interference with, its processes: see Patrick Stevedores Operations No 2 Pty Ltd v Maritime Union of Australia (No 3) [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 195 CLR 1 (' Patrick' ), at 32-33 [35] per Brennan CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, and at 61-62 [127] per Gaudron J; and Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 at 217-218 [10] - [12] and [15] per Gleeson CJ, at 231-232 [60] per Gaudron J, and at 241 [91] and 242-243 [93]-[94] per Gummow and Hayne JJ.The authorities establish that Courts can restrain executive action where it poses a real risk of interfering with the processes of the Court or the administration of justice generally: see Brambles Holdings Limited v Trade Practices Commission (1980) 32 ALR 328; Hammond v Commonwealth [1982] HCA 42 ; (1982) 152 CLR 188; and Victoria v Australian Building Construction Employees &amp; Builders Labourers' Federation [1982] HCA 31 ; (1982) 152 CLR 25.Where the Court is considering an interlocutory injunction based on an apprehended contempt of Court, the Court asks whether the conduct poses a real risk of interfering with the processes of the Court or the administration of justice generally.As this question will only arise on the interlocutory application, and not at trial, the question is not normally posed in terms of a serious question to be tried.Rather, the question is whether the evidence establishes a real risk of interference.In the circumstances of this case, I am not satisfied that the material demonstrates a real risk that the publication of the documents will interfere with the processes of the Court or the administration of justice generally.I have reached that conclusion for several reasons.In the first place, AWB provided the documents to the Commission pursuant to notices to produce on the footing that the documents are no longer the subject of the claim for legal professional privilege.Any conduct by AWB from which waiver could be imputed ended at the point at which it disclosed the references to legal advice to the Inquiry.Any further publication beyond that point is solely attributable to the first respondent.Further, AWB has asserted a claim for confidentiality and it has asked the Commission not to publish the documents on grounds of confidentiality.Section 6D of the Royal Commissions Act 1902  gives the first respondent the power to direct that documents relevant to his inquiries not be published.The terms of reference of the Inquiry also contemplate that the first respondent will take steps to protect the confidentiality of documents where it is appropriate to do so.AWB's claim for confidentiality was founded on the same risk of prejudice as underpins this application; there was no claim for commercial confidentiality.The first respondent rejected the claim for confidentiality and has apparently formed the view that it is necessary to publish the documents for the purposes of the forthcoming hearings.In claiming confidentiality (albeit unsuccessfully) and in making this application for an interlocutory injunction, AWB has done everything within its power to prevent the publication of the documents.It is difficult to see why, in those circumstances, the step that the Inquiry wishes to take of publishing the documents on its website would increase the risk that AWB's conduct would be regarded as effecting a waiver of privilege over other documents.Imputed waiver arises where the party claiming legal professional privilege engages in conduct which is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 at 13 [29] .Secondly, the references to legal advice in the documents have essentially the same character as other disclosures that AWB has previously made to the Commission.Those disclosures have been the subject of evidence in public proceedings at the Inquiry, and are already in the public domain.It is difficult to see why the additional references in the documents to legal advice would alter the risk of waiver that AWB already confronts as a result of the prior publication of very similar material.Thirdly, in the course of this case, the Commonwealth has relied upon previous occasions on which AWB has disclosed the existence and substance of legal advice to contend that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated documents.Mr Harrison, senior counsel for the Commonwealth, informed the Court that the Commonwealth does not intend to rely upon the further references to legal advice in the documents in support of its waiver arguments in these proceedings.AWB argues that, even if these additional references are not to be relied upon by the Commonwealth in this case, that does not remove the risk that in another piece of litigation, at some later point, some other party will seek to rely upon these additional references to argue that AWB has thereby waived privilege over other documents.I do not think that this possible future circumstance supports AWB's contention that publication poses a real risk of interference with the processes of this Court or the administration of justice generally.AWB did not base its application on any contention that the first respondent had exercised his powers improperly or for any extraneous purpose.Its application was based solely on principles of contempt of Court.BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE Turning to the balance of convenience, I am not satisfied that the publication of the documents will cause irreparable harm or any serious prejudice to AWB.In my view, the risk of prejudice to which AWB points is remote.I must also take account of the public interest in the conduct of the Inquiry and the first respondent's desire to conduct further proceedings in public at which these additional documents may be the subject of evidence.This consideration outweighs the remote risk of any prejudice to AWB.CONCLUSION For these reasons, I refuse the application for interlocutory relief.I will vacate the order which I made on 9 August 2006.I will also dismiss the notice of motion dated 10 August 2006.</doc>

and secondly, that the reports were not properly the subject of a notice to produce in an application for preliminary discovery under O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules .The principles relating to leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment were discussed in Decor Corporation Pty Ltd and Anor v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 at 398-9.The Court there accepted that the major considerations in determining whether leave should be granted are: 1) whether the decision is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant its being reconsidered; and 2) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were to be refused, supposing the decision to be wrong.However, the Court in Decor added (at 399-400): However, there will continue to be cases raising special considerations, and the court should not regard its hands as tied in any case beyond this; that by s 24 the legislature has evinced a policy against the bringing of interlocutory appeals except where the court, acting judicially, finds reason to grant leave.When the court comes to exercise its discretion on a particular application, an important distinction to be observed is that between the common interlocutory decision on a point of practice --- concerning which the High Court has given (see Adam P Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Philip Morris Inc [1981] HCA 39 ; (1981) 148 CLR 170 at 177) a strong warning that "a tight rein" should be kept on appeals --- and an interlocutory decision determining a substantive right --- where leave will more readily be granted.The applicant submits that the May decision in respect of the operation of s 56 of the APRA Act is attended by sufficient doubt to warrant leave being granted.In the May decision, I held that s 56 of the APRA Act prevented disclosure of the draft reports to the Court.The applicant says the doubt arises because the issue is essentially a matter of statutory construction, and there is no other authority dealing with the issue.The applicant submits that the question involves resolving a tension between the apparent prohibition under the APRA Act and the rights of an applicant pursuant to the ADJR Act.The respondent submits that there is clearly no doubt that the May decision is correct and that s 56 evinces a clear legislative intention to prohibit production of these documents.It submits that the purposes of the Insurance Act would be subverted if the documents were produced.It refers to s 125 of the Insurance Act which acknowledges that s 56 of the APRA Act prohibits certain disclosures of information under the Insurance Act .In the May decision I rejected the applicant's submission that review of the lawfulness of the exercise of a power bestowed by a prudential regulation framework law is a review for the purposes of a prudential regulation framework law.I accept however that there is no other authority upon this point, and that it raises an important issue relating to the relationship between the APRA Act and the rights of administrative review arising under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977  ('ADJR Act') and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 .I also acknowledge that the point is not entirely unarguable.The applicant further submits that, if leave were not granted, and the decision were wrong, the applicant may suffer substantial injustice as a result of my determination of the effect of s 56.The applicant submits that the decision may give rise to an issue estoppel in future proceedings, both in the preliminary discovery application and in any future ADJR Act application which is made.I accept that there is a real prospect that the May decision could give rise to an issue estoppel which would prevent the applicant from obtaining access to the draft or final reports in subsequent proceedings.The May decision also clearly has a bearing upon the outcome of this preliminary discovery application.If my decision were wrong, and leave to appeal were not granted, it would be likely to restrict severely the ability of the applicant to seek judicial review of APRA's report.In these circumstances, the decision to refuse leave could produce substantial injustice.Accordingly, I consider it to be important that the applicant have the opportunity to challenge my decision in relation to the effect of s 56 of the APRA Act.I consider it appropriate for leave to be granted in relation to this issue.I now turn to the applicant's submissions in relation to the notice to produce procedure on an application for preliminary discovery.In the May decision, the Court rejected the applicant's attempt to gain access to the entirety of the draft reports using a notice to produce on an application for preliminary discovery.In written submissions the applicant said that this is not a case in which the applicant did not possess sufficient factual material to substantiate O 15A r 6 of the Federal Court Rules .That rule requires that an applicant seeking preliminary discovery have a reasonable cause to believe that he or she may have the right to obtain relief from a person whose description has been ascertained.However, in oral submissions in reply, the applicant retreated from this position slightly, indicating that there was a possibility that the Court would not agree that it had sufficient information, and the applicant might be prejudiced by the May decision by not having access to the additional material.The respondent says that, if the applicant has sufficient information to establish its claim under O 15A r 6, as he originally submitted, then there could be no substantial prejudice accruing to the applicant from the failure to gain access to the draft reports.The applicant further submits that there is a factual dispute between the parties relating to whether the applicant was subjected to differential treatment.The reports are sought for the purpose of providing evidence to support the applicant's claim.The applicant submits that the Full Federal Court decision in Tyco Australia Pty Ltd v Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 115 ; (2005) 142 FCR 428 is authority for the proposition that notices to produce may be issued in respect of factual disputes on preliminary discovery applications.In the May decision, I found that there was no relevant factual dispute between the parties.I remain of the opinion that the 'factual dispute' alleged by the applicant is in fact a legal dispute about the effect of facts which are not in dispute, and that the sole purpose of the notice to produce is to elicit further facts on which it can rely and not to resolve any factual disagreement.Nonetheless, I accept that Hill J's judgment in Tyco does not explicitly address the nature and extent of factual disputes which would allow a notice to produce to be issued on an application for preliminary discovery.To my knowledge, there is no other significant authority on this issue and it is a question which is likely to arise in the future.I also accept the respondent's submission that, given the applicant's submission that it has sufficient information to substantiate O 15A r 6, it is difficult to see how the applicant could suffer any prejudice if leave to appeal were not granted with respect to the May decision on this point.Further, I consider that the question raised by the applicant on this point is a matter of procedure, for which leave would usually not be granted.If leave were being sought upon this point alone, I would decline to grant leave.However, for the reasons expressed above, I consider it to be appropriate that leave be granted in respect of the s 56 point.If leave were granted on that point but not in relation to the notice to produce question, it would make the appeal before the Full Court an academic exercise, because the May decision would be ultimately unaffected regardless of the findings of the Full Court.For this reason I propose to grant leave to appeal on both grounds sought by the applicant.</doc>
<doc id="AU38" url="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/1071.html" title="fulltext/06_1071.xml">applicant, a married person who had undergone sex affirmation surgery, applied for alteration of birth registerregistrar refused registration on ground that pt 4a of births, deaths and marriages registration act 1996  did not allow such alteration in respect of married personsdiscriminationThe applicant was born in Victoria in 1944.The applicant's birth was registered in the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages with male given names and the sex recorded as male.In 1967 the applicant married a woman.They remain married but live separately.The applicant changed her given names to female names and on 31 March 2000 was issued with a new birth certificate under Pt 4 of the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1996  (the BDM Act).The certificate showed the new female given names, and not the former male given names, but still recorded the sex as male.On 20 April 2002 the applicant completed the surgical phase of sex affirmation surgery.This involved the alteration of the applicant's reproductive organs for the purpose of assisting the applicant to be considered a member of the female sex.The applicant subsequently applied to the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages for alteration of the record of her sex in the birth register.The Registrar stated that she could not proceed with the application because the applicant was married and thus did not meet the criteria of ss 30A and 30C of the BDM Act.The applicant seeks, under s 46PO of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986 , a declaration that the Registrar has unlawfully discriminated against her and an order that the Registrar alter the record of the applicant's sex in her birth registration.Compensation in the agreed sum of $1000 is sought.A claim for an apology is no longer pursued.The parties agree that the Court should decide the following question:Was the refusal of the Registrar to consider on its merits the application to alter the record or to alter the record of the applicant's sex in the applicant's birth registration an act which constituted unlawful discrimination on the ground of marital status within the meaning of s 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 ?The words emphasised were added in the course of the hearing in circumstances to which I shall later refer.The BDM Act Part 4A entitled "Recognition of Sex (Transexualism)" was inserted in the BDM Act in 2004.It provides for application to the Registrar for the record of a person's sex to be altered (s 30A).Statutory declarations by two doctors as to the person having undergone sex affirmation surgery is required (s 30B).Section 30C provides for altering the Register and s 30D for the issue of a new birth certificate.The terms of s 30A and 30C are relevant to the present case.They provide:A.An unmarried person --- who is 18 years or over; and whose birth is registered in Victoria; and who has undergone sex affirmation surgery --- may apply to the Registrar for the record of the person's sex in the person's birth registration to be altered.An application must be in the form approved by the Registrar and must be accompanied by the prescribed fee (if any).C.Alteration of Register The Registrar must determine an application under section 30A by altering the record of the applicant's sex in the applicant's birth registration or refusing to do so.Before determining the application, the Registrar may require the applicant to provide such further information or documentation as the Registrar reasonably considers is necessary.The Registrar cannot make the alteration to the birth registration if the applicant is married.As stated by the Attorney General for Victoria, the Honourable Robert Hulls MP, the legislative policy behind ss 30A and 30C is to avoid any question whether the person is in a same sex marriage: Hansard , 11 May 2004 at 1107.The applicant made an application in the approved form.In the form a declaration included the statement:I declare that I am unmarried and 18 years of age or over.The applicant struck out the letters " un " and wrote on the form " I am married but separated ".The applicant accompanied the form with a letter dated 20 June 2005 which drew attention to her annotation on the form and stated:although I have been separated from my legal spouse for more than six years, I remain in a valid marriage.In a letter dated 12 July 2005 in response to the application the Registrar noted that the applicant had stated that she was currently married.The Registrar quoted the terms of ss 30A and 30C and stated:Consequently, as your request does not meet the criteria of the legislation I cannot proceed with your application.The Registrar advised that the prescribed application fee had not been charged against the applicant's credit card.The Sex Discrimination Act Section 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984  relevantly provides:It is unlawful for a person who, whether for payment or not, provides goods or services ... to discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person's sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy: by refusing to provide the other person with those goods or services ..." Assuming for the moment that alteration of the Birth Register is a "service", s 22 on its face would clearly apply to the Registrar's refusal in this case since it expressly refers to discrimination on the grounds of marital status (s 22 provides that the section binds the Crown in right of a State).However, the operation of s 22 is limited by s 9.Section 9 provides that the prescribed provisions of Pt II (which include s 22) have effect as provided by ... the following provisions of this section and not otherwise.The following provisions of s 9 include subsection  which refers to "the Convention", earlier identified in s 4 as the " Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ".Section 9 provides:If the Convention is in force in relation to Australia [which is in fact the case] the prescribed provisions of Pt II [i.e.including s 22] ... have effect in relation to discrimination against women, to the extent that the provisions give effect to the Convention.The purpose of s 9 is to ensure that the prescribed provisions have effect in relation to matters falling within the scope of the legislative powers of the Commonwealth: South Pacific Hotels Pty Ltd v Trainor [2005] FCAFC 130 ; (2005) 144 FCR 402 at [19] .Other subsections of s 9 will give effect to prescribed provisions such as s 22 in particular circumstances coming within Commonwealth power, for example when there is discrimination by a trading or financial corporation on the ground of a person's marital status: s 9.Issues The issues raised by the present application therefore are:Whether, having regard to s 9 and  of the Sex Discrimination Act , s 22 of the Act applies at all to the Registrar's conduct; and If it does, whether the Registrar's conduct constituted refusing to provide a service.Issue  --- Application of s 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act give effect to the Convention" Giving effect in this context means giving legal effect, creating legally enforceable, rights, duties, powers and privileges: cf Re Pacific Coal Pty Ltd; Ex Parte Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2000] HCA 34 ; (2000) 203 CLR 346 at [209] , [211].The Convention, being an international instrument, does not apply of its own force as part of Australian domestic law enforceable in Australian courts: Secretary of State for India v K B Sahaba (1859) 13 Moo PCC 22 at 75, 15 ER 9 at 28-29, cited in Queensland v The Commonwealth [1989] HCA 36 ; (1989) 167 CLR 232 at 239.The terms of the Convention do not directly prohibit or mandate conduct by individuals.By the Convention States Parties undertake to take measures, including legislative measures, which will help to eliminate discrimination against women.For example, by Article 2States Parties ... undertake: To adopt legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women.In the present case s 9 and  require the Court to ask whether s 22 , insofar as it prohibits discrimination on the grounds of marital status, would be discharging one or other of the legislative obligations Australia has undertaken by becoming a State Party to the Convention.Section 22 only has effect if it gives effect to the Convention.The present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s 22.The question is not whether Parliament has made a legislative judgment that a treaty obligation exists, in which case it is enough that " the legislative judgment could reasonably be made " ( Richardson v Forestry Commission [1988] HCA 10 ; (1988) 164 CLR 261 at 295-296).Rather, as Ms Mortimer SC for the Registrar submitted, Parliament has made the legislative judgment.It is expressed in ss 9 and , and s 22.The Court must construe the language of those provisions.There must be an examination of the Convention to ascertain to what Australia has undertaken to give effect by way of legislation.Preamble to the Convention At the outset the Preamble notes that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person " and in the equal rights of men and women ".It also notes that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination, that all human beings are born free and equal, and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, " without discrimination of any kind, including distinction based on sex ".The Preamble then notes that States Parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights have the obligation to ensure " the equal right of men and women " to enjoy all economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights.The Preamble then records consideration of the international conventions concluded under the auspices of the UN and the specialized agencies promoting " equality of rights of men and women ", and the resolutions, declarations and recommendations of the UN and the agencies promoting such equality.The Preamble then records concern that, despite these various instruments, " extensive discrimination against women continues to exist ".The Preamble then recalls that " discrimination against women " violates the principles of equality of rights and respect for human dignity and is an obstacle to " the participation of women on equal terms with men " in the political, social, economic and cultural life of their countries, hampers the growth of prosperity of society and the family and makes more difficult " the full development of the potentialities of women " in the service of their countries and of humanity.The Preamble then records the parties' concern that in situations of poverty women have less access to food, health, education, training and opportunities for employment and other needs, and its conviction that the new international economic order based on equity and justice will contribute significantly towards the promotion of " equality between men and women ".The Preamble then emphasises that the eradication of apartheid, racism, colonialism and interference in the internal affairs of States is essential to the full enjoyment of the rights of men and women and affirms that the strengthening of international peace and security and other international measures such as disarmament will promote social progress and development and as a consequence will contribute to the attainment of " full equality between men and women ".The Preamble then states that the parties are convinced that the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace require the " maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields ".The Preamble then, bearing in mind the great contribution of women to the welfare of the family and the development of society and the role of both parents in the family and in the upbringing of children, notes the parties' awareness that the role of women in procreation should not be a basis for discrimination but that the upbringing of children requires a " sharing of responsibilities between men and women and society as a whole ".The Preamble then notes awareness that a change in the traditional role of men as well as that of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve " full equality between men and women ".The Preamble then records awareness that a change in the traditional role of men as well as the role of women in society and in the family is needed to achieve " full equality between men and women ".Finally, the Preamble records the parties' determination to implement the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and, for that purpose, to adopt the measures required for the elimination of such discrimination in all its forms and manifestations.The object and purpose of the Convention emerge clearly from the Preamble.Against a background that restates the conviction that discrimination in general is an abuse of inalienable human rights as well as being economically wasteful, the Convention addresses a particular species of the genus discrimination, namely discrimination against women.Discrimination against women means treating women less favourably than men because they are women.In the terminology of discrimination law the " comparator " is men.Thus the Preamble repeatedly refers to equality between men and women.Conversely, there is no suggestion in the Preamble that the Convention is concerned with discrimination where persons are treated unfavourably because of some other attribute, such as race or religion, irrespective of whether they are male or female.The Convention then proceeds to a definition of the term " discrimination against women " and particular provisions directed at discrimination against women in various walks of life.Convention definition of "discrimination against women" Article 1 provides:For the purposes of the Convention, the term 'discrimination against women' shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.The reference to "marital status" operates as a reminder that one familiar form of discrimination against women has been treating women less favourably than men where women were married.For example, in common law countries, before the enactment of legislation like the Married Women's Property Act 1870 , a woman's personal property vested in her husband upon marriage and he had the sole right of controlling and managing her freehold estates: Cheshire and Burn's Modern Law of Real Property , 13 th ed, at 864.Another example is legislation in Australia which barred married women from employment (or sometimes permanent employment) in the public service.Thus the definition makes it clear that the Convention is concerned with discrimination against all women, married and unmarried, including discrimination (ie less favourable treatment than men) against women because they are married (or unmarried) women.That the definition does not extend to discrimination against all persons, male or female, simply on the ground of marital status, and is confined to discrimination against women, is confirmed by an example of the construction given by the international community (as to the admissibility of such material see Queensland v The Commonwealth , above, at 240).The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on 31 July 1995 issued, in the course of its third periodic reports of States Parties to the Convention, the report of the United Kingdom Government.An annexure is a document entitled "Commentary on UK Reservations and Declarations, Statement entered by the United Kingdom on 7 April 1986".At page 126, under the heading "Article 1" there is quoted an earlier reservation of the UK which was in these terms:With reference to the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and other applicable legislation, the United Kingdom's acceptance of Article 1 is subject to the reservation that the phrase "irrespective of their marital status" shall not be taken to render discriminatory any difference of treatment accorded to single persons as against married persons, so long as there is equality of treatment as between married men and married women and as between single men and single women.It is then said:This statement clarifies the UK's understanding of this Article.The UK Government still believes that it is an accurate statement of the Article's meaning.However, the Government accepts that there is no need for this still to be explicitly stated.On this basis the UK Government wishes to withdraw the statement.Operative provisions of the Convention Article 2 provides (emphasis added):States Parties condemn discrimination against women in all its forms, agree to pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating discrimination against women and, to this end, undertake: To embody the principle of the equality of men and women in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation if not yet incorporated therein and to ensure, through law and other appropriate means, the practical realisation of this principle; To adopt appropriate legislative and other measures, including sanctions where appropriate, prohibiting all discrimination against women; To establish legal protection of the rights of women on an equal basis with men and to ensure through competent national tribunals and other public institutions the effective protection of women against any act of discrimination; To refrain from engaging in any act or practice of discrimination against women and to ensure that public authorities and institutions shall act in conformity with this obligation; To take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, organisation or enterprise; To take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices which constitute discrimination against women; To repeal all national penal provisions which constitute discrimination against women.Read together with the Preamble and the definition of " discrimination against women ", the obligations undertaken in Article 2 are clearly confined to acting (and refraining from acting) in relation to disadvantage suffered by women as compared with men.Article 3 requires States Parties to take all appropriate measures, including legislation, in all fields, in particular in the political, social, economic and cultural fields, to ensure the full development and advancement of women for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms " on a basis of equality with men ".Article 4.1 legitimises what is sometimes referred to as affirmative action.Adoption by State Parties of special temporary measures aimed at accelerating " de facto equality between men and women " shall not be considered discrimination but shall not entail the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; such measures are to be discontinued when the objectives of " equality of opportunity and treatment " have been achieved.The equality spoken of is that between men and women.This limited and temporary exception for inequality emphasises that the main purpose of the Convention is the attainment of equality between men and women.Article 5 requires the taking of appropriate measures to modify social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women to achieve the elimination of prejudices based on the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.Article 6 requires States Parties to take measures to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women.Since exploitation of women for sexual purposes has notoriously been an activity of men in the roles of pimps, procurers and white slavers, this provision of the Convention is directed to another area of inequality of women as compared with men.Article 7 deals with political and public life.State Parties are to take appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women to ensure rights to vote and hold public office " on equal terms with men ".Article 8 requires measures to ensure to women " on equal terms with men " the opportunity to represent their Governments at the international level.Article 9 obligates States Parties to grant women " equal rights with men " in relation to nationality and the nationality of their children.Article 10 is concerned with measures to ensure to women " equal rights with men " in the field of education and various rights such as career guidance and access to curricula " on a basis of equality of men and women ".Article 11.1 deals with employment.Measures are to be taken to eliminate discrimination in that field to ensure to women rights such as the right to work " on a basis of equality of men and women ".Article 11.2 provides:In order to prevent discrimination against women on the grounds of marriage or maternity and to ensure their effective right to work, States Parties shall take appropriate measures: To prohibit, subject to the imposition of sanctions, dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy or of maternity leave and discrimination in dismissals on the basis of marital status; To introduce maternity leave with pay or with comparable social benefits without loss of former employment, seniority or social allowances; To encourage the provision of the necessary supporting social services to enable parents to combine family obligations with work responsibilities and participation in public life, in particular through promoting the establishment and development of a network of child-care facilities; To provide special protection to women during pregnancy in types of work proved to be harmful to them.It is wholly consistent with the object of the Convention to provide for the elimination of conduct which operates to disadvantage women vis-a-vis men either because women experience conditions which, for biological reasons, men do not, such as pregnancy and maternity, or because laws or social practices have disadvantaged women in some contexts such as marriage.Article 12.1 requires States Parties to eliminate discrimination against women to ensure " on a basis of equality of men and women " access to health care.Article 12.2 provides that notwithstanding Article 12.1 States Parties should ensure to women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy and confinement.Again this is a recognition that equality for women with men is not to be denied because some particular benefits or services are by their nature only available to women.Article 13 provides for measures to eliminate discrimination against women in other areas of economic and social life to ensure " on a basis of equality of men and women, the same rights ".Article 15 provides for the according to women of " equality with men before the law " in matters such as contractual and property rights.Article 16.1 provides:States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations and in particular shall ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women: The same right to enter into marriage; The same right freely to choose a spouse and to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent; The same rights and responsibilities during marriage and at its dissolution; The same rights and responsibilities as parents, irrespective of their marital status, in matters relating to their children; in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount; The same rights to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information, education and means to enable them to exercise these rights; The same rights and responsibilities with regard to guardianship, wardship, trusteeship and adoption of children, or similar institutions where these concepts exist in national legislation; in all cases the interests of the children shall be paramount; The same personal rights as husband and wife, including the right to choose a family name, a profession and an occupation; The same rights for both spouses in respect of the ownership, acquisition, management, administration, enjoyment and disposition of property, whether free of charge or for a valuable consideration.This Article is consistent with the purpose of the Convention, namely to attain equality between men and women in all spheres of life including, as provided for in Article 16.1, marriage.Applicant's submissions on the aim of the Convention Ms McLeod SC for the applicant submitted that the Convention is aimed at the elimination of discrimination against women in all its forms.Thus far, I agree.She went on to submit that one such form is discrimination " on the basis of marital status " and that the elimination of discrimination against women on the basis of marital status is a " secondary aim " of the Convention.But one cannot leave out an essential element of the concept of discrimination against women, that is to say the denial of equality with men.Marital status and the incidents of marriage is one of many areas in which women may be treated unequally, as compared with men, because they are women.The Convention is not concerned with discrimination which may affect women and men indifferently because it is based on other factors, such as race or religion.Ms McLeod said that the text of the Convention draws a distinction between provisions that eliminate any form of discrimination against women and those that are aimed to ensure equality between men and women.She pointed to a number of provisions which concern " discrimination against women " and which, she said, do not refer to the need for equality with men, namely Article 2 , ,  and  (quoted at [37] above), Article 6 ([41] above) and Article 7 ([42] above).However, most of these provisions explicitly refer to " discrimination against women ", a concept which, as defined in Article 1 ([34] above), is premised on the absence of equality between men and women.And, as has been seen, the Preamble enshrines equality as between men and women as the lodestar of the Convention.Conversely, the Convention does not deal with marital status discrimination per se , which must mean discrimination against, any persons, whether men or women, on the ground that they are married, or unmarried.The discrimination contemplated by the Convention includes discrimination against women because of their marital status.But this necessarily involves discrimination against a person who is both a woman and married (or unmarried).Alternative argument of Sex Discrimination Commissioner Mr Lenehan on behalf of the Sex Discrimination Commissioner , who was given leave to appear as amicus curiae , supported the applicant's arguments.He also advanced an alternative argument.He submitted that even if marital status discrimination is not covered by Article 1 of the Convention, the application of s 22 of the Sex Discrimination Act to marital status discrimination is within the limits of s 51(xxix) of the Constitution (the external affairs power) and thus s 9 of the Act.He argued that the proscription of marital status discrimination against women will prevent the perpetuation of negative stereotypes about women and can therefore be seen as a means of " nipping in the bud" conduct which may grow into or foster " discrimination against women " within the meaning of Article 1.He referred to Article 5 ([40] above) and cited the decision of a Full Court of this Court in Toben v Jones [2003] FCAFC 137 ; (2003) 129 FCR 515.In Toben the appellant had been found by a determination of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to have engaged in racial vilification contrary to s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 .He contended that provision was invalid because the source of the s 51(xxix) external affairs power relied on, the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination , was concerned with the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred whereas s 18C was intended only to proscribe acts which could be characterised as expressions of racial hatred.In other words, as I understand the argument, the Act did not give effect to the relevant Convention because it did not go far enough, it did not fully implement the Convention.Carr J (with whom Kiefel J agreed) at [18] accepted that the Act did not fully implement Article 4 of the Convention because provisions in the Bill which created criminal offences in respect of racial hatred had been rejected by Parliament.However, his Honour at [20] said that it was clearly consistent with the provisions of the Convention that a State Partyshould legislate to 'nip in the bud' the doing of offensive, insulting, humiliating or intimidating public acts which are done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin before such acts can grow into incitement or promotion of racial hatred or discrimination.it is for the legislature to choose the means by which it carries into or gives effect to a treaty ..." As already mentioned, the present case is not concerned with the Constitutional validity of s 22.In any event, for the reasons given above, the Convention with which this case is concerned addresses discrimination against women, in the sense defined in Article 1, including discrimination which treats women less favourably than men who have the same marital status.But s 22, which applies to discrimination against men or women, married or unmarried, on the ground of marital status, is not, so to speak, a step along the way to some greater goal concerned with discrimination against women only.In so far as s 22 is concerned with stereotypes, it is the stereotype that might arise from a person being married, or unmarried, irrespective of sex.In Toben the nature of the discrimination (racial) was the subject of both the Convention and Act --- the point was that the prohibition in the latter only extended to less severe forms of discriminatory conduct than the former.In the present case, discrimination on the ground of marital status per se is not some less severe form of discrimination against women.The "nip in the bud" analysis does not apply.Section 9 speaks of "giv effect to the Convention" .A major element, albeit not the only one, of the Convention is the obligation undertaken by States Parties to legislate in a number of areas to proscribe discrimination against women.Section 22 being legislation, and not some other form of governmental activity (such as, for example, public education or governmental employment practices) is part of Australia's discharge of its obligation to legislate as required by the Convention.It is therefore to be construed as prohibiting discrimination against women --- treating them less favourably than men --- because they are married.The action of the Registrar in the present case had nothing to do with the applicant's being a woman.Had the applicant been a man, the result of the application would have been the same.Issue  must be resolved in the negative.It is not strictly necessary therefore to consider the second issue, but since the matter was fully argued I shall proceed to do so.Issue  --- Did the Registrar refuse to provide a service?Ms McLeod submitted that the Registrar contravened s 22 by refusing to consider the application " on its merits ".The Registrar should have gone beyond a " blanket refusal ".The decision involved an "analysis of the factual content, the supporting material, the weighing of relevant discretionary factors and so on ".When it was pointed that this argument did not fit the agreed question, Ms McLeod sought the amendment which appears in [8] above.For her part, Ms Mortimer submitted that, on analysis, the Registrar's conduct involved three steps.The Registrar receives the application, she considers it and she disposes of it.She has not refused to do any of those things.What she has refused to do is alter the record.That is no more than the " outcome of the three steps " each of which can constitute a service.However, the refusal to alter the record is " but the outcome ".Both arguments seem to me to introduce an unnecessary degree of subtlety into a simple process.The arguments apparently proceeded from a perceived need to accord with what some members of the High Court said in IW v City of Perth [1997] HCA 30 ; (1997) 191 CLR 1.But that case dealt with a town planning decision, an administrative decision of a very different nature.Service" involves an "act of helpful activity" or "the supplying of any ... activities ... required or demanded" (Macquarie Dictionary) or "the action of serving, helping, or benefiting, conduct tending to the welfare or advantage of another" (Shorter Oxford Dictionary).Altering the Birth Register was an activity.The applicant requested the Registrar to perform that activity.The carrying out of that activity would have conferred a benefit on the applicant.The Registrar, because of the terms of the BDM Act, declined the request to carry out that activity.This was the refusal of a service.An activity carried out by a government official can none the less be one which confers a benefit on an individual.Much of governmental activity today involves the conferring of benefits on individuals.The BDM Act itself recognises this.For example the Registrar may enter into an arrangement for the provision of "additional services" (s 51) and the Governor in Council may make regulation prescribing fees with respect to searches etc and "other services provided by the Registrar" (s 59).Order The application will be dismissed.Since there is an important public issue involved in this case, I am tentatively disposed not to make an order for costs against the applicant, but I will hear submissions from counsel if necessary.</doc>

materialfailure to take into account relevant considerationsdistinction between failure to deal with evidence and failure to address claimno jurisdictional errormigrationmigrationIntroduction The appellant is a citizen of India.He was granted a form of visa by the Department entitling him to remain temporarily in Australia.When that visa expired, he applied for a Student Temporary (Class TU) Subclass 572 visa.One of the criteria for the grant of the Subclass 572 visa was that the appellant establish "exceptional reasons" for the grant of that form of visa.The appellant sought to establish the existence of exceptional reasons on a number of different bases.One of them was that he was unable to travel to India because he suffered severe back pain.He said that he should therefore be permitted to remain in Australia to undertake a course of study for which he was enrolled.A delegate of the Minister refused to grant the visa.The Migration Review Tribunal affirmed the decision, finding amongst other things that the report of a physician submitted by the appellant in support of his claim did not establish that he was unable to travel.Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones dismissed an application for review of the decision of the MRT.The appellant appeals against the decision of the Federal Magistrate.The essential issue which arises on the appeal is whether the MRT failed to have regard to certain other medical evidence and, if so, whether that constituted jurisdictional error.Background I will not set out the provisions of Clause 572.227 of Schedule 2 of the Migration Regulations 1994  under which the claim arose.The statutory framework is set out and explained in the decisions of the MRT and the Federal Magistrate.It is, however, necessary to refer briefly to some of the background material before turning to the decisions of the MRT and the learned Federal Magistrate.On 13 April 2004 the appellant's solicitors wrote to the MRT submitting that there were exceptional reasons for the grant of the visa.The letter stated that the appellant's Doctor had advised him to refrain from lengthy travel because he had, in medical terms, "mild diffuse posterior contained bulge of L4-6, L5-S1 disks --- ".A copy of a CT scan obtained in India by the appellant in 2001 was annexed in support of the statement made by the solicitors.The appellant followed up on the letter from his solicitors by providing a report of Dr Rajesh Dinakar dated 19 May 2004 to the MRT.Dr Dinakar is a medical practitioner in general practice.The Doctor's report stated that the appellant was suffering from lower back pain and that he was being treated with anti-inflammatory medication.On 25 May 2004 a case officer from the MRT wrote to Dr Dinakar in response to the report.The letter stated that the MRT needed to ascertain whether the Doctor could "unequivocally corroborate" that the appellant's condition prevented him from undertaking international travel.On 30 May 2004, Dr Dinakar write to the MRT.The letter stated, relevantly:- After going through all the investigations he was submitted to whilst his recent short visit to India, I have no doubt what-so-ever that this man indeed has a very bad back will prevent him travelling long distances.I cannot for sure mention any adverse effects that would be sustained should he venture on a long distance travel, APART FROM, MAY BE DISCOMFORT.An expert opinion by an Orthopaedic Surgeon will be more appropriate in this man's situation.original emphasis) After it had received the report from Dr Dinakar, the MRT wrote to the appellant on 30 June 2004.The letter was written pursuant to s 359 of the Migration Act 1958 .The MRT invited the appellant, pursuant to that section, to provide the following information:- An expert opinion from an orthopaedic surgeon regarding your current back condition.In particular, whether your condition prevents you from undertaking international travel and any adverse effects that would be sustained by you should you travel to India.On about 30 July 2004, the appellant wrote to the case officer at the MRT stating that, in response to the invitation to provide more information, Dr Dinakar had referred the appellant to Dr Patapanian.The appellant's letter requested the case officer to provide additional time to enable him to see Dr Patapanian.In September 2004, the appellant submitted Dr Patapanian's report to the MRT.The report was dated 23 August 2004.The report stated, relevantly:- This patient exhibited no clinical features to convincingly suggest the presence of spinal cord compression or injury.Recent x-rays do not show signs of sacroiliitis or significant disc disease although do show a shallow thoracic-lumbar scoliosis.An MRI scan performed India three years ago is quite unremarkable, with well preserved disks and no signs of neuro compromise at any level.I have reassured him that his symptoms almost certainly mechanical in nature and have checked some basic blood tests.He does not have a Medicare card and investigations are very expensive for him and given the duration and stability of his symptoms I'm happy that at this stage we can hold off with additional investigation.I have given him some basic exercises and have emphasised to him the importance of the physical approach in these situations.I would like to review this patient in three months or earlier if there are problems.original emphasis) In its reasons for decision, the MRT at [30] stated that it accepted that Dr Patapanian's report acknowledged the appellant had some back pain.However, the MRT did not "see this as exceptional and prohibitive in allowing the visa applicant to travel.The decision of the Federal Magistrate Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones referred at [21] of his judgment to the appellant's submission that the MRT did not have regard to all the medical reports and that it ignored relevant evidence.The learned Federal Magistrate observed that, despite this contention, there was no doubt that the MRT was familiar with all the reports.This was because the exchange of correspondence between the MRT and the doctors led to the preparation of the reports.His Honour observed that in those circumstances it was difficult to accept that the MRT did not have regard to all of the reports.He went on to say that the MRT was not required to record in its decision all the material that it had considered.Reference was made to the decision of a Full Court in MZWBW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 94.The learned Federal Magistrate also observed at [25] that the appellant knew exactly what he was required to prove and was given the opportunity of obtaining the evidence.His Honour said that Dr Patapanian's clear diagnosis was that there was no substantial medical or clinical basis for any claim of discomfort on the appellant's part.He also said that it was open for the MRT to conclude that the appellant did not have a condition that would prevent him from travelling long distances.Grounds of Appeal Mr Young, counsel for the appellant, conceded that the appellant's grounds of appeal may be reduced to two.The first ground is that the MRT failed to have regard in its reasons to important material going to an essential issue in the case.The second ground is that the MRT failed to take into account relevant considerations, namely the existence of other medical evidence, in particular the report of Dr Dinakar dated 30 May 2004.Failure to have regard to the other medical reports The substance of Mr Young's argument was that the MRT fell into error because it failed to have regard to the other medical evidence, in particular Dr Dinakar's report of 30 May 2004.He drew attention to those parts of the report which stated that the appellant would be unable to travel long distances.Mr Young submitted that the species of error upon which he relied was not co-extensive with errant fact finding.He relied in particular on the decision of a Full Court (Lee, Carr and Tamberlin JJ) in WAFP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 319.In WAFP their Honours set aside a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal stating at [19] that the RRT had failed to have regard "to important relevant material going to a central consideration" in the case.Their Honours went on at [21] to say that the RRT failed to have regard to "relevant material, which is so fundamental that it goes to jurisdiction: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 ... at [82].The language used by their Honours in WAFP was broad.It might, in one sense, be thought to support the appellant's submission in the present case.However, in my view, the Full Court in WAFP , by referring to "important relevant material", did not intend to elevate a failure to refer to evidence to a ground of jurisdictional error.If it did, the decision in WAFP would be contrary to established principles.This is clear, not only from what the High Court said in Yusuf , but also from other authorities which explain the boundaries between errant fact finding and jurisdictional error.In Htun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) 194 ALR 244 at [42], Allsop J (with whom Spender J agreed) pointed to the distinction between failure to deal with an aspect of the evidence and failure to address a claim or an integer of the claim.Also, in Rezaei v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1294 at [57] , Allsop J observed that Yusuf does not stand for the proposition that a tribunal has failed to take into account a relevant consideration merely because it has not referred to a piece of evidence which the Court thinks relevant.His Honour supported this proposition by reference to Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 39-42.It is also amply supported by the observations of McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Yusuf at [73], [74], [82] and [84].To this may be added the endorsement of the relevant passage in Rezaei by the Full Court in MZWBW (to which Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones referred) at [26] and Thirukkumar v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 268 at [29] .In Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389, Gummow and Callinan JJ said at [24] that a failure by the Refugee Review Tribunal to respond to a substantial, clearly articulated argument relying upon established facts amounted to a denial of natural justice.However, this does not assist the appellant's argument in the present case because Dranichnikov must be understood as a failure by the tribunal to deal with a claim; see NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 at [63] .Moreover, it is plain from Yusuf at [68]-[69] that s 368 of the Migration Act (and its equivalent in s 430), requires the tribunal to set out only the findings it did make, not the findings it did not make.Thus, as was said by a Full Court (French, Sackville and Hely JJ) in WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 75 ALD 630 at [46], it is not necessary for a tribunal to refer to every piece of evidence and every contention of an applicant in its written reasons; there is a distinction between failure to refer to evidence and failure to address a contention which constitutes a claim or an integer of a claim.This passage of WAEE was referred to with approval by the Full Court in MZWBW at [27].It was also referred to by Federal Magistrate Lloyd-Jones in his reference to the relevant paragraph of MZWBW.When the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons are considered in light of these well established statements of principle, they can be seen to be entirely without error.Indeed, his Honour's finding at [21] that the MRT must have had regard to other medical evidence, including that of Dr Dinakar, though not essential to the correctness of the decision, seems to me to be entirely correct.Given the process which led to the production and submission of Dr Patapanian's report, it is difficult to accept the appellant's submission that the MRT failed to have regard to the earlier reports.What is more, the MRT's failure to refer to Dr Dinakar's report is quite understandable.This is because the last sentence of the report of 30 May 2004 specifically deferred to the more expert opinion of a specialist.Dr Patapanian was the very specialist to whom Dr Dinakar referred the appellant for an opinion on the question of whether he was able to travel.Notwithstanding this, Dr Patapanian made no mention of that issue.Dr Patapanian's failure to refer to that issue is not supportive of the appellant's claim.As the learned Federal Magistrate said at [25], given the doctor's diagnosis, it was open for the MRT to make a finding that he did not have the condition he asserted.Failure to refer to relevant considerations The contention that the MRT failed to refer to a relevant consideration, namely the other medical evidence, fails for the reasons I have set out above.To the references I have already given, may be added the remarks of Allsop J (with whom Heerey J relevantly agreed), in Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at [79] .His Honour there observed that whatever the outer boundaries of relevant and irrelevant considerations, they do not encompass a failure expressly to mention part of a competing body of evidence before the tribunal, provided that the elements or integers of the claim are addressed.Here, it is plain that the MRT addressed the appellant's claim that his medical condition prevented him from travelling overseas.The appellant's submission that the MRT was required to expressly grapple with the other medical evidence is outside the boundaries of judicial review.Orders The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</doc>

or is an auditor of the body; or is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of the body; or is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of a body corporate that is a mortgagee of property of the body; or is not a registered liquidator; or is a director, secretary, senior manager or employee of a body corporate related to the body; or unless ASIC directs in writing that this paragraph does not apply in relation to the person in relation to the body--has at any time within the last 12 months been an officer or promoter of the body or of a related body corporate.This subsection refers to appointments or administrations after a scheme has been approved by the Court.However, Mr Owens, counsel for the plaintiffs, while contending that the role played by Mr Littlewood as a director of NRG Victory does not signify that he will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme, asks that, if I should take a different view, leave be granted to Mr Littlewood to administer that scheme.I agree with Mr Owens that the mere fact that Mr Littlewood will continue to be, and will act as, a director of NRG Victory does not signify that he will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme.The notion of what it means to administer a compromise or arrangement for the purposes of subs 411 is not defined in the Act.In the present case, the general administrator of the NRG Victory Scheme is NRG Victory itself.Mr Littlewood is only one of three directors of that company even though his knowledge and his role in the past no doubt signify that he is, and will continue to be, a key person in terms of the day-to-day administration of the company.There is, however, nothing to suggest that his co-directors act at his behest or that directorial decisions are not taken by the three directorsWhile I do not give an advisory opinion (even the granting of leave would not protect Mr Littlewood if he should step outside the terms of the leave granted), in deciding whether to approve the Schemes I have come to the view that Mr Littlewood's mere status as one of three directors of NRG Victory, coupled with the fact that his company, Littlewoods Services Pty Ltd, may continue to provide administrative services to that company, do not, without more, indicate that Mr Littlewood will be administering the NRG Victory Scheme.There may be a question whether Mark Moyes and Scott Collings will be administering certain aspects of the Schemes, and, therefore, to the extent necessary, I will grant them leave to do so, even though they are not registered liquidators.Both Schemes should be approved.I make orders 1 to 5 of short minutes of order initialled by me, dated today and placed with the papers.</doc>

trusteeconsideration of whether a proper foundation subsisted for the exercise of a power to fix costsconsideration of the source of the powerconsideration of the intersection between such a power and s 162 of the bankruptcy act 1966 .bankruptcyThis is an appeal which by the very nature of the subject matter of the controversy gives rise to difficult matters for each of the parties upon resolution.The appellant is the trustee of the estate of the respondent in bankruptcy and contends that Federal Magistrate Coker made findings unsupported by the evidence that; actions taken by the trustee in the course of the administration of the estate were 'unprofessional'; costs, charges, expenses and remuneration incurred in the administration of the estate were 'extremely excessive'; and the refusal of the trustee to be satisfied of the matters contemplated by s 153A of the Bankruptcy Act 1966  ('the Act') until complaints made by the respondent concerning the trustee's conduct of the administration were resolved, amounted to 'extreme and inappropriate bullying'.The appellant further contends that Federal Magistrate Coker, by fixing the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration of the trustee at $15,000.00 (subject to adjustment for prior payments) for the period from 20 June 2003 (the date of the making of the sequestration order) to 10 February 2004 (the date when his Honour found that the administration ought to have been brought to an end), erred , because his Honour had no power to make such an order, or, if such a power subsists, the exercise of the power miscarried having regard to those factors that influenced the exercise of the discretion .Accordingly, the appellant seeks to set aside the order fixing the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration of the trustee at $15,000.00 and the order that there be no costs of the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court and, in their place, seeks orders that:the appellant is entitled to costs, charges, expenses and remuneration for the period 20 June 2003 to 5 November 2004 at $40,109.43 (less $15,000.00 received) and for the period 5 November 2004 to date, remuneration determined in accordance with s 162 of the Act and the recovery of costs, charges and expenses incurred by the trustee on an indemnity basis; andthe costs of the appeal.The respondent confronts the consequences that flow from the making of a sequestration order and the administration of her estate for the purposes of the Act and contends that at all relevant times she was solvent; the sequestration order ought not to have been made; and many steps were taken by the trustee that were costly, unnecessary and had the effect of diluting the residual value of the estate for the beneficiary after the discharge of the debts due to creditors and payment of properly incurred costs, charges and expenses of the administration and the remuneration of the trustee.Further, the respondent contends that costs (both remuneration and expenses) incurred by the trustee in responding to complaints made by the respondent concerning the conduct of the administration, ought not, in the circumstances, be paid by the estate and the insistence by the appellant of resolving a challenge to the conduct of the trustee, within the administration, rather than effecting an annulment of the sequestration order and then responding to a subsequent challenge (possibly pursuant to s 179 of the Act) by seeking security for costs, made the administration, unnecessarily expensive.In the context of the issues raised on the appeal, the respondent contends that the above considerations provide a basis for the findings of Federal Magistrate Coker and result in the exercise of a discretion, conferred by s 30 of the Act, to fix the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration of the trustee on a basis thought appropriate.Consistent with the familiar passage in House v The King [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 (and particularly the passage at p 505 of the judgment of their Honours Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ), the exercise of the discretion ought not to be disturbed.The respondent in oral submissions also relied upon s 179 of the Act as the source of the power to fix the amount of the costs (expenses and remuneration) at $15,000.00.The appellant contends that s 179 was not relied upon by the respondent in the proceedings before Federal Magistrate Coker; was raised for the first time in oral submissions in the hearing of the appeal; and the respondent ought not to be allowed to now rely upon s 179 as that section contemplates a particular process which is inconsistent with the conduct of the respondent's application and had the respondent relied upon s 179 , the appellant would have conducted its response to the application differently.Supplementary written submissions have been directed to the question of s 179.In resolving these competing contentions it has been necessary to closely examine considerable material concerning the precise chronology of events inherent in the administration and the various propositions put to the trustee and the trustee's response.In dealing with the questions raised on the appeal, it is not the role of the appellate court to resolve contested questions of fact.However, in determining whether the exercise of a power or discretion (if conferred) miscarried, it is necessary to look at the evidence before Federal Magistrate Coker and consider the material in the context of the matters that influenced his Honour to exercise the power in a particular way or to reach particular conclusions.The application for leave to amend the notice of appeal The appellant seeks leave to amend the notice of appeal and relies upon two affidavits of James Nicholas Conomos filed 23 November 2005 and 29 November 2005 respectively which exhibit an amended notice of appeal and a further amended notice of appeal.Although Mr Laurie, counsel for the respondent, objects to the lateness of the amendments, Mr Laurie concedes that the respondent has suffered no prejudice by reason of the late notice of the proposed changes.The proposed changes to the amended notice of appeal are not significant.Accordingly, leave is given to amend the notice of appeal in terms of the document described as Exhibit 'JNC1' to the affidavit of James Nicholas Conomos filed on 29 November 2005.Background to the respondent's application before Federal Magistrate Coker On 20 June 2003, the Registrar of the Federal Magistrates Court made an order for the sequestration of the estate of Ms Townsend.The application was made by Ms Townsend's former partner as a result of an unpaid costs order made against Ms Townsend in family law proceedings.It seems the solicitors for Ms Townsend's former partner were instructed to take all necessary steps to recover the amount of the assessed costs.The affidavit evidence suggests that Ms Townsend's former partner did not anticipate that such action would result in a sequestration order.Nevertheless, the amount of the costs remained unpaid after service of the certificate, service of a bankruptcy notice and service of an application for a sequestration order.The costs remained unpaid at the date of the hearing of the application.At the hearing, Ms Townsend contended that she was solvent as the value of her assets exceeded the amount due and payable to her creditors (including the amount of the costs order).It is not clear whether any undertaking to discharge the debts within a particular period, or, by recourse to support from a third party, supported by an affidavit to that effect, was offered as an element of a request for an adjournment of the hearing of the application.In any event, the Registrar was satisfied that there was a proper basis for making a sequestration order presumably on the ground that the material in support of the application and the history of a failure to pay or compromise the unpaid costs claim established that Ms Townsend could not pay her debts as and when they fell due for payment notwithstanding the contended surplus of assets over liabilities.Federal Magistrate Coker concluded in his reasons published on 19 May 2005 in support of an order made by the court on 22 April 2005 annulling the bankruptcy of Ms Townsend that for the purposes of s 153B of the Act, the sequestration order ought not to have been made.That finding is not challenged by the appellant.The respondent says that on the material available to the trustee in the face of the sequestration order, it must have been apparent that Ms Townsend was, in fact, solvent; the order was made in the context of a relationship dispute; the amount of the unpaid costs order was approximately $6,000.00; and the administration of the estate was very likely to be uncomplicated and capable of resolution in a speedy way not attended by the incurring of significant costs, charges and expenses or significance remuneration on the part of the trustee.The appellant says that all steps taken by him were reasonable and necessary either in the discharge of statutory responsibilities or as a function of the prudential administration of the estate.On 25 June 2003, the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend and set out a number of important matters.They included:a statement of the purpose of the bankruptcy;a statement of the obligation upon Ms Townsend to make out and file a Statement of Affairs (setting out full details of assets and liabilities) within 14 days of 20 June 2003, in the office of the Official Receiver and provide a copy of that document to the trustee.A Statement of Affairs form was enclosed.The letter advised Ms Townsend that she could either provide the original to the trustee for lodging with the Official Receiver or she could complete and file the original document with the Official Receiver and provide the trustee with a copy and a letter from the Official Receiver confirming the date of filing the original document;the obligation to deliver books and records (including taxation returns, cheque butts etc) for the previous two years relating to Ms Townsend's financial affairs to the trustee;the requirement to advise the trustee of material changes to the Statement of Affairs, changes in the address of the bankrupt, the provision of information as required to the trustee, the disclosure of property details and other matters.The letter enclosed, apart from the Statement of Affairs form, a document entitled 'Written Information or Explanation Required', copies of ss 115 to 122 of the Bankruptcy Act and provisions from the Bankruptcy Act dealing with items of public examination, co-operation and disclosure.On 14 July 2003, Ms Townsend wrote to the trustee explaining the circumstances that led to the costs order and the financial difficulties confronting Ms Townsend by reason of the costs order.In the letter of 14 July 2003, Ms Townsend said this:My financial circumstances have not improved although I do have considerable equity in my family home and a block of land.This equity is well in excess of what is owed to my creditors.However, I do not want my family home sold unnecessarily because it will cause undue stress to both my daughter and myself.My block of land is attached to the same mortgage.In order that I may have the bankruptcy annulled in accordance with section 153A of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 a third party has offered to pay the creditors and your costs.I undertake that this matter may be resolved, within 30 days, without the need for further expense being incurred on your part.In accordance my obligations under the Bankruptcy Act I will provide you with a list of creditors with respect of debts that have been provided.Ms Townsend then said this:Take notice that any action taken by you to enforce the terms of the Bankruptcy Act before the expiration of that 30 days would cause me and my daughter unnecessary harm and on the basis of my undertaking that the matter may be resolved I require that you undertake that yourself and the employees or agents of ACP Insolvency will not take any further action that would result in further or unnecessary cost to me until I have had that reasonable opportunity unless you show cause why your intervention would not be both unnecessary and vexatious.In order to expedite the resolution of this matter I require, as soon as practicable, a particularised account of your costs to date for my consideration as well as details of the Applicant's taxed costs the subject of the Bankruptcy Notice.On 20 August 2003, the trustee sent Ms Townsend by email a draft Schedule of Remuneration and Expenses and said: 'It is subject to revision, may not include all costs to date, and does not provide for future costs, nor 8% ITSA fee charged on all receipts.GST is to be added' .ITSA is an acronym for Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia .On 25 September 2003, the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend in these terms:I understand you complain that you have on numerous occasions asked that I give permission for you to arrange for your creditors to be paid directly to reduce costs and the 8% ITSA realisation charge, I have failed to give such permission, and it is because of such failure that you are now chasing up such a letter.I deny this.You do not need my permission to arrange for your creditors to be paid directly.I have never said anything to the contrary --- see, for instance, my letter to you of 2 September 2003.Your "divisible assets", however, are vested in me and you have no ability to sell or charge such assets to pay your creditors.I further understand you consider that the additional costs incurred by these telephone calls and letters should not be charged to the bankruptcy, and therefore not required to be paid.The work properly carried out or yet to be carried out by me in this administration will be charged to the administration.This includes your telephone call to this office earlier today, our subsequent telephone call and this reply.Could you please provide  written evidence that all creditors set out in my letter of 22 September 2003 have been paid (and provide a receipt from each creditor --- or preferably an express notice of withdrawal of their proof of debt --- that I can independently confirm with the relevant creditor), or  advise that you dispute the creditor's claim.In which case I will consider what amount is properly due to such creditor.In a period from 25 June 2003 to December 2003 a number of exchanges occurred between Ms Townsend and the trustee that are particularly contentious.Ms Townsend swore an affidavit on 16 February 2004 in which she says this:she met with Mr Carey of the trustee's office on 25 June 2003;she told Mr Carey she wished to cooperate in the interest of expediency; she gave Mr Carey 'all information regarding my estate';she met with Mr Carey for 148 minutes but Mr Carey 'took none of the documents I was prepared to give him'; she told Mr Carey that she wished to annul the bankruptcy;she understood Mr Carey would cause a caveat to be lodged concerning a property at Hoffschidldt Drive rather than effect a transfer of title to the trustee; she agreed with Mr Carey that the trustee would not take any action for two weeks; she and Mr Carey agreed that Ms Townsend would pay her four creditors directly and she would only pay those creditors that lodged a proof of debt in the bankruptcy; and she understood that nothing would be done to liquidate the residence at Hoffschidldt Drive or vacant land owned by Ms Townsend at Hattonvale in Queensland.Ms Townsend in her affidavit refers to the letter of 14 July 2003 and a request for a statement of the trustee's costs to that date.She says:on 15 July 2003 the trustee effected a transfer of title of the properties to him despite an agreement to the contrary;on 20 August 2003 Ms Townsend received an informal Bill of Costs (interim) subject to GST;the interim bill reflects 'charges being made against my estate for such complex documents as a 'Strategic Plan' followed by a 'Review of Action Plan';a 'very simple four creditor estate [is] being given the enormous over administration of a corporate disaster';by 27 November 2003 Ms Townsend had paid all creditors including the trustee's costs but was unable to secure certification from the trustee to that effect so as to secure an annulment of the bankruptcy by operation of s 153A of the Act;on 15 December 2003 the trustee advised her that the administration was not complete and a further report would issue in two months time.It is clear that Ms Townsend had a certain perception of what the trustee should do and not do in the administration of the estate and a perception of the amount of the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration that ought to be incurred.In response to Ms Townsend's contentions, the trustee filed an affidavit in which specific allegations are contested and the foundation for Ms Townsend's perceptions are contradicted.The trustee in his affidavit says:at the date of receipt of the letter of 14 July 2003, the bankrupt had not completed a Statement of Affairs as required by the Act.the Statement of Affairs was lodged on 15 July 2003 and failed to disclose a creditor, namely, Ms Townsend's former solicitors; the trustee did not agree to simply lodge a caveat against dealing in the two properties rather than transfer the land to the trustee as the trustee had an obligation to preserve those assets to, potentially, pay creditors; the Bill of Costs of 20 August 2003 was plainly a draft and Ms Townsend was told the draft bill did not include any estimate for future costs, GST or a fee payable to ITSA of 8% of all receipts; the preparation of a Strategic Plan for an administration is a document required or recommended to be prepared in the Personal Insolvency National Standards document issued by ITSA and the Insolvency Practitioners' Association of Australia .The plan is not a complex document and in the administration of Ms Townsend's estate, preparation of the document involved 10 minutes of work on 26 June 2003 including the signing of a letter to the bankrupt's bank; the estate is not 'a very simple administration' nor has the estate been 'over administered'; a report was made to creditors dated 12 December 2003 which contained a brief explanation of work done up to 11 December 2003; the bankrupt although unhappy about costs was advised of a right to have the costs taxed or assessed; although Ms Townsend contended she had the ability to pay her creditors, she had a number of creditors and one of them had obtained a sequestration order leading the trustee to believe Ms Townsend may not have had the ability to pay her creditors as and when they fell due and the bankrupt proposed to call in aid sources other than her divisible assets for the payment those debts; notwithstanding a fax from the trustee to the bank to place a freeze upon credit funds in the account of the bankrupt, Ms Townsend withdrew the bulk of the credit funds in that account and failed to forward those funds to the trustee.The trustee contended that the reason why Ms Townsend did not receive any certificate for the purposes of s 153A upon or immediately after receipt of Ms Townsend's letter of 27 November 2003 was that the trustee was not satisfied that Ms Townsend had paid all her debts, including the costs of the administration as required by the Act.Ms Townsend was advised of the trustee's lack of satisfaction on that matter by letter dated 28 November 2003.Moreover, the trustee was required to provide a report to creditors which occurred on 12 December 2003.That report contained details of work undertaken in the administration and a corresponding Bill of Costs to the date of the report.The bankrupt or any creditor had the right to, within 28 days of receiving the report, request that the bill be referred to taxation.Accordingly, the administration could not be finalised until at least after the time period for requiring taxation had expired.The trustee deposed to the remuneration arrangements in this way at paragraphs 19 and 20 of the trustee's affidavit sworn 29 March 2004:I say I originally sought and obtained approval from creditors for my remuneration to be on a time-cost basis at certain specified rates up to a maximum of $6,600 (including GST).Subsequently, after writing to creditors and providing them with an update of the administration, their approval was given for an increase to a maximum remuneration of $8,800 (including GST) at those specified charge out rates.Following my obtaining appropriate approval on 12 December 2003, I drew $8,099.10 of the $8,800 maximum potential remuneration at specified charge out rates, and provided creditors and the bankrupt applicant with the material about my remuneration up to 11 December 2003 as required by s 162 of the Act and Reg 8.12 of the Regulations.A copy of my letter dated 15 December 2003 to the bankrupt enclosing such report (Report to Creditors) is annexed.Since providing this information, no one (including the bankrupt) has required that my remuneration of $8,099.10 that was drawn be taxed as permitted by Reg 8.09.As to costs, expenses and remuneration from 11 December 2003, the trustee said this at paragraph 21 of the affidavit:Further work has been carried out, a substantial part of which has arisen from having to deal with complaints of the bankrupt applicant made either to me or made by the bankrupt applicant to the Bankruptcy Regulation section of ITSA.Certain steps need to be taken to finalise the administration, for instance revesting title in the real estate transmitted to me back into the name of the bankrupt, preparing a final account of receipts and payments, and several other tasks.Accordingly, I propose to recover any further lawful remuneration in excess of the amount already drawn down and any unpaid expenses either from further payments made by or on behalf of the bankrupt, or, if need be, from the sale of the bankrupt's divisible assets.Again, details of the additional remuneration will be provided to the creditors and the bankrupt, and creditors and the bankrupt will have the right to require taxation of such additional remuneration.At 29 March 2004, three payments had been made in the administration.The first was an amount of $8,099.10 paid on 12 December 2003 in respect of the trustee's remuneration.The second was a payment of $800.00 made on 29 January 2004 in respect of a mandatory charge payable to the Commonwealth Government under the Bankruptcy (Estate Charges) Act 1997  and the third payment of $764.42 was made on 27 March 2004 in respect of rates levied by the Gold Coast City Council concerning the property at 56 Hoffschidldt Drive, Currumbin Waters.At 29 March 2004, $336.48 was held in the administration bank account.In general terms, the trustee denied the allegation that the administration had been conducted contrary to the interests of the applicant or in a malicious way and asserted that the work undertaken in the administration was consistent with the proper administration of the estate and responsibilities required under the Act.In further general terms, Mr Carey filed an affidavit which contested a number of the matters Ms Townsend asserted.Mr Carey says that Ms Townsend did not produce any documents to him whatsoever nor tender any documents to him at the meeting on 25 June 2003.Mr Carey says he did not refuse to accept any documents.Mr Carey says that the bankrupt was in a distressed state and a considerable amount of time was spent explaining the bankruptcy process.Mr Carey says Ms Townsend agreed to complete the Statement of Affairs and return it promptly.As to the properties, Mr Carey says no action was to be taken to sell the properties in the immediate future and that this would allow Ms Townsend time to complete the Statement of Affairs and return it to the trustee.These matters are mentioned in some detail because they illustrate the divergence of approach between the trustee and the bankrupt.Ms Townsend was agitating for very little to be done and purporting to direct the trustee not to do things against the background of allegations that taking steps would be both unnecessary and vexatious.On the other hand, the trustee says he identified a statement of the necessary steps taken in the administration, submitted that description to the creditors for approval and contends that the steps taken by him represent the orthodox and proper administration of the estate.On 7 November 2003, Ms Townsend wrote to the trustee and raised a number of complaints including these matters:in order for the trustee to perform his functions under the Act, it was only necessary for the trustee to notify creditors of the bankrupt of the administration and determine whether the estate included property that could be realised to pay a dividend to creditors;the delays in dealing with proofs of debt on the part of the trustee had caused a third party, Ms Helen Thompson, to withdraw a proposal to provide funds to pay creditors;Ms Townsend attempted to begin making payments to creditors and contacted St George Bank to arrange payments from her Visa account and personal loan accounts and was advised that she would require written authorisation from the trustee.Ms Townsend complains about the trustee's conduct in dealing with that matter;Ms Townsend complains about what she describes as unauthorised meetings and phone calls by the trustee, unnecessary correspondence, excessive costs in obtaining information, unnecessary facsimiles sent by the trustee, unnecessary conversations by Mr Carey with particular creditors (PCCR, St George Bank and other entities) and other unnecessary communications;Mr Carey held unauthorised meetings and telephone conversations with Mr Halpin, Ms Davis and Ms Thompson on 30 June 2003, 21 July 2003 and 18 August 2003; andexcessive costs were incurred in conducting telephone discussions with PCCR and others.In light of all of these complaints, Ms Townsend offered to pay on 7 November 2003, $4,500.00 as full and final payment of the trustee's administrative costs.It is plain that at this time Ms Townsend was asserting her view of the limited nature of the steps that she thought were 'reasonable' and her view as to whether particular conversations, steps, correspondence and other communications ought to have been undertaken by the trustee and his staff.Ms Townsend concluded her letter of 7 November 2003 with these observations:If you elect to reject my offer I require that you provide valid reasons as to why you consistently failed or refused to exercise your power and perform your functions as a Commonwealth Officer to administer my affairs in a manner affording unnecessary expense as well as in a commercially sound way.If you attempt to enforce payment in excess of the amount offered without providing those valid reasons as well as providing a valid explanation as to why particular statements were made in your letter dated 22 October 2003 or to do any other thing, either by act or by omission, that may affect me in an adverse way financially, without cause, I shall commence private criminal proceedings under section 13 of the Crimes Act 1914  with respect to offences under Chapter 7 of the Criminal Code Act 1995  in the Magistrates Court at Townsville pursuant to s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 .I warn you that giving false and misleading information is a serious offence.On 25 November 2003, the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend in respect of the costs question (which was subsequently the subject matter of Mr Brake's affidavit).The trustee said this:I am not in a position to provide a written fixed price invoice for final payment of the costs of the bankruptcy administration.The administration is ongoing and further costs continue to be incurred.I understand you have not paid the claim of Redpath as set out in his proof of debt and unless he withdraws his proof of debt, I am required to adjudicate on his claim.I refer to the draft outline of costs set out in my letter to you earlier today.That, together with GST and the 8% ITSA fee, amounts to approximately $8,200.00.The actual costs incurred to date may be somewhat more or somewhat less than that outlined, and further work needs to be carried out.To obtain an annulment of the bankruptcy, I suggest you pay $10,000.00 to me.I presently consider that this is likely to cover the costs of the bankruptcy, but please note that this is just my current opinion not a statement of fact.If and when I am satisfied that all your debts (as defined in section 153A of the Bankruptcy Act ) have been paid, your bankruptcy will be annulled.The suggestion that the amount paid be $10,000.00 at the present time is on the basis that, amongst other matters, all creditors who have lodged proofs of debt have been paid and they withdraw their claims.To date, no creditor who has lodged a proof of debt has contacted me to withdraw their claim, so I will have to contact them.I will also have to go back to creditors to seek further fee approval as the current limit has been exceeded.On 25 November 2003, the trustee wrote a further letter to Ms Townsend advising that he did not consider that it would serve any useful purpose to respond to the various allegations made by her although if Ms Townsend wished him to do so, he would respond.As to the offer of $4,500.00, the trustee rejected the offer and said that a cheque sent to him for that amount would be returned to the drawer of the cheque.On 25 November 2003, Ms Townsend wrote to the trustee providing confirmation of payment from third party sources of four creditors, namely, Laidley Shire Council, St George Bank, Lehns Solicitors and 'PCCR'.A further amount was to be paid to PCCR upon a certain event happening.As to the $4,500.00, Ms Townsend told the trustee he should retain that amount as part payment of the $10,000.00 previously requested although Ms Townsend put the matter on the basis of the 'amount that I have agreed to pay to annul the bankruptcy and allow me to pursue creditors outside the bankruptcy' .The balance of $5,500.00 was to be paid within a short period of 25 November 2003.On 27 November 2003, Ms Townsend wrote to the trustee advising of certain further arrangements to complete the payment to creditors of amounts due to them.The letter confirmed a funds transfer to PCCR Lawyers of $3,000.00, a payment to Mr Redpath of $451.45 and a payment to the trustee of $5,500.00.Ms Townsend sought confirmation from the trustee that the proof of payment from the particular creditors now supplied was sufficient in respect of those creditors who had lodged proofs of debt.Ms Townsend raised again the possibility of an annulment.On 28 November 2003, the trustee responded and acknowledged the receipt of $5,500.00 which aggregated with the earlier payment represented $10,000.00 'received on the terms set out in my letter of 25 November 2003' .The trustee advised that he had not yet received a withdrawal of a proof of debt from PCCR or Mr Redpath but that would no doubt follow shortly.As to the annulment, the trustee said:Your bankruptcy will be annulled if and when the conditions set out in section 153A of the Bankruptcy Act are satisfied.Assuming that all proofs of debt have been withdrawn (or rejected by me on the basis that the relevant claim has been paid), and no further proofs are received, the only outstanding issue I currently foresee will be assuring that the costs, charges and expenses of the administration, including my remuneration and expenses, are ascertained and paid in full.I will provide creditors and you with the information required regarding my remuneration and the receipts and payments in the administration.If any creditor or you require taxation, given that only $10,000.00 is held, it is likely the annulment will not take place until taxation is completed.The trustee also said this:Furthermore I note that you have made various allegations against me, including threatening to launch a private prosecution.I consider your allegations unfounded.If I am to carry out work or incur expenses in responding to such allegations, then some or all of the costs involved may be properly chargeable to your estate, and therefore I will need to be paid prior to any annulment occurring.I currently intend to provide you with a release whereby you release me from such allegations (this release will not seek to limit your right to require taxation --- that is a separate issue).If you choose not to sign the release, then I will either  seek a ruling from the court, or  obtain specific insurance to protect me against any future claim you may make against me, or  wait seven years until the limitation period for bringing an action against me expires, or the proceedings you bring are finalised.I consider the proper costs of resolving the allegations you made will (subject to any ruling that a court may make) be charged to your estate in bankruptcy.If you do not wish to consider signing a release, please advise me promptly as there is no point in me preparing a release for your consideration if you are not prepared to consider it in any event.As to the resolution of the financial affairs, the trustee said this: I refer to your request that I do not discuss the state of your affairs with any of your creditors.I bear in mind your request, but will carry out my obligations and exercise my discretions as I am required to do under the Bankruptcy Act .The Bankruptcy Act requires trustees to automatically provide certain details of receipts and payments (including remuneration).The proper costs incurred by trustees in providing the details as required by the Bankruptcy Act is a cost of the administration, and would be paid out of the estate assets.If you want further details not normally required, I am happy to consider providing them but you would have to pay the costs of preparing such additional details not required by law.As I have already advised, the Bankruptcy Act provides that subject to certain conditions, you have the ability to require taxation.This in turn would involve additional potential benefits and risks, and I suggest that you seek legal advice in that regard.On 8 December 2003, Ms Townsend wrote an extensive letter to Mr Robert Tom the Director of Bankruptcy Regulation at ITSA.In that letter, Ms Townsend expressed serious concerns about the manner in which the trustee had conducted the administration of her bankrupt estate and, in particular, complained as to the unnecessary and excessive costs, the general conduct of the administration and the proposition that the trustee had placed conditions upon any release of Ms Townsend from bankruptcy outside those conditions contemplated by the Act.Ms Townsend further contended that the trustee had conducted the administration in a way that was deceptive and misleading and proceeded to set out the history of events in part recorded in these reasons.The detail of the letter deals with the specific conduct of the administration and the notion that correspondence, communications and particular steps were taken which were unnecessary.Ms Townsend said that she maintained that the account '... should not be more than $3,000.00 in total and that Paul Brake abused his statutory powers and failed in his statutory duty of trust' .Ms Townsend set out her view that s 19 of the Act only required the trustee to notify the bankrupt creditors of the bankruptcy and determine the extent of the estate that might be realised to pay a dividend to creditors.Ms Townsend contended that she could see no basis upon which an amount of $10,000.00 could properly have been incurred in the administration of the estate.On 15 December 2003, the trustee, as deposed in his affidavit, wrote to Ms Townsend and enclosed a copy of his report to creditors dated 12 December 2003.On 14 January 2004, Ms Townsend sent an email to Mr Barrett at ITSA in these terms:I hereby revoke my verbal consent previously given, allowing ITSA to forward copies of my letter of complaint and various written correspondence to Mr Brake giving him the opportunity to respond to my complaints.The reason for this is that according to you, Greg, there is nothing ITSA can do to stop Mr Brake from charging my estate for his time required to respond to my complaints.I would like you to proceed with any investigations that will not involve Mr Brake's time.The part of the inquiry involving Mr Brake's time to respond should proceed only after my bankruptcy is annulled.In the past Mr Brake has always charged my estate to speak with ITSA regarding complaints I have made.I will contact you upon the annulment of the bankruptcy.I would like to formally request that you provide me with a copy of the letter and all documents that have been sent to Mr Brake.Further, please take notice, in regards the taxing of the bill, I wish to have the bill taxed however will advise you at a later date when I would like you to proceed with the taxing.I am currently awaiting an itemised bill from Mr Brake.To date he has only provided me with a draft bill.On 10 February 2004, the trustee wrote an important letter to Ms Townsend in these terms:I am satisfied that any creditors who have lodged proofs of debt have been paid, and where appropriate I have given notice of rejection of the claim (in one case the period to appeal from my rejection has not expired, but clearly I do not anticipate any appeal).I consider that your bankruptcy will be annulled under section 153A of the Bankruptcy Act as soon as my remuneration and expenses have been paid.I note my remuneration up to 12 December 2003 has been advised to you and creditors, no request for taxation has been received, and I am proceeding on the basis that the issue of what is my remuneration up to 12 December 2003 is now finalised.My remuneration for work carried out from 13 December 2003 to the present time is approximately $1,300.00 (plus GST) --- according to my time --- costing records.While I appreciate limited work to progress the file was carried out post 12 December 2003, work (which entailed costs) was carried out to begin to respond to your letter of complaint to ITSA dated 8 December 2003.Such costs ceased to be incurred after being advised that, to avoid further costs, you did not wish me to respond further].In addition there is approximately $580.00 (plus GST) for expenses, a total of say $2,200.00 (including the 8% ITSA charge and GST) --- subject to correction of errors and omissions.I hold $1,100.90 at the present time (being the $10,000.00 received, less remuneration of $8,099.10 and less the 8% ITSA realisation fee of $800.00).Unavoidable costs to complete the administration would include seeking approval for further remuneration, writing a final report to creditors, and re-transmitting the two properties back to you.Provided I am satisfied that any rates that accrued during the bankruptcy in relation to either property have had been paid, if I did not have to consider the issues set out in the next paragraph, I consider that upon receipt of the further $2,300.00 (including GST, the government charges on re-transmitting the land and 8% ITSA charge) I could draw down all or the major part of the costs to complete, prepare and lodge any land transfer forms, and issue an annulment certificate under section 153A of the Bankruptcy Act .I emphasise that this 'guestimate' of costs to complete is on the basis that the finalisation proceeds smoothly, and is in any event only my 'guestimate' at the present time.Details of my expenses and post 12 December 2003 remuneration would be notified to you and creditors.If you (or a creditor) consider that such costs are excessive that can be taxed if required .Once the costs are determined (one way or another), if there was a surplus, the excess would be refunded to you.If there was a shortfall, then the shortfall would be recoverable from you (notwithstanding any annulment that may have occurred in the meantime).One significant potential additional cost is the potential cost of responding to the various complaints and allegations that you have made or may make in the future in respect to my work.I note if all you wish to do is require my remuneration or costs to be taxed, then so be it (subject to you complying with any time limits or making a successful application to extend any time limit).I can finalise the file without making any further provision for the potential costs of taxation (given that, in the event that the bill is reduced by less than 15%, you will have to pay both the taxing fee and my costs of the taxation).If, however, you have already referred (or in the future refer) your complaints to the Federal Police, or have already commenced a private prosecution against me (or in the future commence such a private prosecution), or make a complaint in some way other than by requiring taxation then it is difficult to provide a good estimate to you of the costs to finalise the administration.I note that any potential investigation or private prosecution may not be finalised for several years and the costs of responding to that may be thousands of dollars.I consider it appropriate that our respective rights and obligations be finalised on a timely basis.I can apply to the court for a release and/or seek directions as to how your allegations should be dealt with.The costs of making such an application may be considerable.I again invite you to consider withdrawing your threat to take any action against me in respect to the work carried out to date, other than requiring costs to be taxed (if you so make available a requirement for taxation).If we are to proceed on this basis, a release would need to be prepared and signed.Previously you've alleged that it was somehow improper to invite you not to undertake not to bring a private prosecution, etc.Frankly, I cannot see it is improper, but you may wish to seek legal advice on this matter .If however, you do not wish to sign a release, I propose to make an application to the court.Please let me know how you wish to proceed.In response to that letter, Ms Townsend filed on 24 February 2004 an application in the court dated 16 February 2004 which sought relief in these terms:That the bankruptcy of the Applicant be annulled on the grounds that the Applicant has paid every creditor in full including trustees' fees; A declaration that the trustee has deliberately contributed to the excessive charges imposed on the bankrupt by over-administering a very simple estate.That the trustee is liable in damages for preventing my dealing with my property during the peak of a real estate boom, prevented me renting it, selling it and charging fees that were excessive in the circumstances.Ms Townsend also sought orders in these terms:Restriction of additional charges being made by the trustee, which the Applicant believes on reasonable grounds are malicious or vindictive.Directions of the court on how to prevent excessive trustee charges for a bankrupt estate that has been finalised directly by the bankrupt.That the dealing with the lands of the Applicant by the trustee be stayed pending decision on the annulment of the bankruptcy of the Applicant.That application was amended on 8 October 2004 so as to reflect an application for 'the annulment of the bankruptcy pursuant to sections 153A and 153B of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (as amended)' .The principal application ultimately came before Federal Magistrate Coker on 5 November 2004.His Honour made orders that the trustee's costs from the date of the sequestration order to 5 November 2004 be taxed; that the costs of both parties be reserved and that the application be adjourned until 15 February 2005.Prior to the hearing of the application on 5 November 2004, further exchanges took place between the trustee and Ms Townsend.On 6 June 2004, the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend in these terms:I refer to your request that I provide an updated figure for estimated outstanding costs and costs to complete.According to my time costing records, and rounding off figures to the nearest dollar, the outstanding remuneration up to yesterday is $9,721.00 with $3,252.00 of expenses (the principal item of expenses being barrister's fees).GST of $1,282.00 needs to be added, bringing the total to $14,255.00.When the 8% ITSA realisation charge is added, the total estimated amount is $15,395.00.Unavoidable costs to complete the administration would include documenting the dismissal or withdrawing of your court proceedings, seeking and obtaining fee approval with a final report to creditors, and re-transmitting the two properties back to you.Provided I am satisfied that any rates that accrued during the bankruptcy in relation to either property had been paid, if I did not have to consider the issues set out in the next paragraph I consider that upon receipt of a further $16,500.00 (including GST and the 8% ITSA charge) I could issue an annulment certificate under section 153A of the Bankruptcy Act .Details of my expenses and post 12 December 2003 remuneration would be notified to you and creditors.The letter then went on to deal again with the question of the costs that might be incurred in dealing with the various complaints either made or to be made by Ms Townsend to the Federal Police or to regulatory bodies.On 15 June 2004, Ms Townsend wrote to the trustee in these terms:I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 6 June 2004.I am writing to advise that I intend to pay your account fees on or about 1 July 2004 sufficient to annul the bankruptcy.I require you to provide a fully itemised, formal, final account for all work completed by you or your employees or agents in association with my bankruptcy since your appointment as trustee of my estate on or about 20 June 2003 and including all necessary work yet to be done to annul the bankruptcy.I require final, formal account within seven days.Please allow for all possible work to be completed to ensure that all your costs will be covered.Should there be a surplus paid, this will be refunded to me upon annulment.Take notice, there are no creditors who require notification regarding your expenses or final reports associated with my bankruptcy.Should you intend to provide this information to any person, business or company other than myself, please provide me with a certified copy of the Authority you are relying on that allows "creditors who have been paid 100% of their debt to continue to be regarded as creditors" in this, or any bankruptcy.Further I require evidence that you are entitled to seek fee approval from anyone other than a current, valid creditor.I am making an application to the court for an Extension of Time to submit my Amended Application.The reason for this is so you are not required to commence work on a Response prior to me being able to finalise your account.Provided I am able to pay your account in full and you annul the bankruptcy, I intend to withdraw my court proceedings.However, as I am unable to make such payment prior to 1 st July 2004, I ask that you will consent to an application for an extension of time to submit my Amended Application to the Federal Magistrates Court due to be filed on 17 June for a further 28 days.Should an unforeseen problem arise in regards payment of your account or you do not annul the bankruptcy, the application for annulment will continue.On 23 June 2004, the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend and enclosed a draft account of 'certain of my remuneration and expenses'.The trustee said the draft account 'is subject to revision, GST has yet to be added, the rates for the work carried out need to be approved, etc.However it should be sufficient to indicate the broad basis of how the level of charges set out in my letter of 6 June 2004 is estimated by me' .As to the estimate of 6 June 2004, the trustee said this:The estimated costs set out in my letter of 6 June 2004 will have, naturally, increased slightly by the work carried out in responding to your further queries.I have raised on several occasions (see, for instance, my letter of 9 February 2004) the difficulty in dealing with determining a level of costs, given your expressed intentions to (in various circumstances) lodge petitions in Parliament, launch a private prosecution against me, etc.Please respond to this issue.If a satisfactory response to the issue of what appears to be a reasonable [y] foreseeable application by you to lodge a petition in Parliament, launch a private prosecution against me etc is received, I consider paying $17,000.00 will provide a reasonable assurance that such sum would be sufficient to cover the remaining costs of the bankruptcy.However, I cannot give a guarantee in that regard, as my rights and obligations are set out in the Bankruptcy Act and applicable case law, etc.' In relation to the question of whether a final report to creditors was necessary, the trustee said the position was not immediately obvious but having regard to s 162 of the Act and particular authorities, the trustee observed:I propose to write to creditors seeking further fee approval up to a further $11,000.00 plus GST (in addition to the remuneration already approved, ie.a total maximum of $19,000.00 plus GST) or such higher amount as may be agreed between you and I.I do not consider that such maximum level of $19,000.00 plus GST will be required, but it seems that such a resolution may avoid yet further costly correspondence with creditors if there are some problems in the future.Creditors and you of course can apply to have any remuneration taxed, provided time limits are complied with or an extension of time is granted.On 5 July 2004, the trustee met with Ms Townsend and on 19 July 2004 the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend setting out a basis for future resolution of the bankruptcy.The elements of that proposal were these:Ms Townsend would cause $23,000.00 to be paid to the trustee.Upon receipt of those funds, the trustee would formulate a claim for remuneration from 12 December 2003 until the date of receipt of the additional monies.Ms Townsend would not make any further complaints to ITSA, lodge petitions in Parliament, launch private prosecutions or institute court proceedings in respect of the conduct of the trustee or his staff from the date of commencement of the bankruptcy.The expression of any dissatisfaction on the part of the bankrupt would be taken up in the forum of a taxation of costs (if a taxation was required).Upon being provided with details of the claim for remuneration for the period from 12 December 2003 to the date of receipt of the additional funds, Ms Townsend might seek to require a taxation of the claim for remuneration (if made within time) or seek a taxation of remuneration already paid to the trustee from 20 June 2003 to 11 December 2003.The trustee observed that 'if any bill is being taxed, you may object to any item in the bill, and for that purpose make such comments or criticisms about my conduct at that time to the taxing officer as you think fit ' .The Trustee observed: 'After the remuneration for the period from 12 December 2003 until the receipt date (or, if applicable, from inception until the receipt date) is determined and paid, a certificate of annulment can, if appropriate, be issued at that time (ie.in advance of all costs being exhaustively determined and paid) --- assuming I am satisfied that the remaining funds in hand are sufficient to cover the costs to complete' .Assuming the work to finalise the administration can be completed, the existing court proceedings would then be dismissed by consent.The cost of work undertaken by the trustee after receipt of the further funds would be agreed between the trustee and Ms Townsend and paid promptly.The trustee observed: 'I will issue a Section 153A Certificate annulling the bankruptcy when I am satisfied that the funds held are sufficient to cover all your "debts" as defined in Section 153A.In that regard, I note that where a certificate of annulment is issued, Section 154 provides that a trustee may apply the property of a former bankrupt still vested in him in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration.Thus it is likely that I can issue you with an annullment certificate even if not all costs are exhaustively determined and paid for, and the two properties not transferred back to you at that stage' .The bankrupt would submit transfer papers to the trustee to facilitate both properties being transmitted to Ms Townsend without further work on the part of the trustee.On 22 July 2004, the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend in relation to obligations on the part of Ms Townsend to provide the trustee with a statement of income derived by her during the 'contribution assessment period' (20 June 2003 to 19 June 2004) and books evidencing the derivation of income during that period.On 16 August 2004, the trustee issued a further report to creditors in which he identified a claim for remuneration for the period 12 December 2003 to 15 January 2004 of $637.12 plus GST and a claim for remuneration for the period 15 January 2004 to 2 August 2004 of $10,934.63 plus GST constituting a total amount of $12,028.09.During August and October further exchanges took place between the trustee and the bankrupt concerning notices from the Gold Coast City Council and the Laidley Shire Council.On 7 October 2004 the trustee provided Ms Townsend with a statement of income during the contribution assessment period.During October further exchanges took place between the trustee and the bankrupt.Ms Townsend made a request of ITSA for the removal of the trustee.ITSA advised that an application would be necessary under s 179 of the Act in the event that the trustee was removed, the Official Trustee could, in particular circumstances, assume the role of trustee of the estate.During October Ms Townsend had further correspondence with ITSA concerning the claim for remuneration by the trustee.On 5 November 2004, Ms Townsend's application pursuant to ss 153A and 153B of the Act was heard by Federal Magistrate Coker.These exchanges demonstrate essentially three phases in the dealings between the trustee and the bankrupt.At first, Ms Townsend was entirely convinced that a trustee administering her estate was required to take very limited steps and that many of the telephone calls taken and received, meetings held, correspondence and facsimiles sent and received were thought to be unnecessary.This view of the requirements or duties cast on the trustee gave rise to Ms Townsend's view that the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration for work undertaken in the administration of the estate must necessarily be limited and could not be more than $3,000.00.Thus, an offer of $4,500.00 was made on 7 November 2003.In the second phase, Ms Townsend accepted that $10,000.00 would be paid to the trustee.The respondent thought by 25 November 2003 that this amount would be sufficient to secure an annulment of the bankruptcy although the appellant on 28 November 2003 re-asserted the qualification upon the 'estimate'.On 8 December 2003, the respondent re-asserted to ITSA her complaints and her view that the fees ought to be only $3,000.00 .The third phase represented the period from 10 February 2004 through to the hearing of the application pursuant to s 153A and s 153B.The letter of the trustee of 10 February 2004 acknowledged the payment of $10,000.00.An amount of $8,899.10 had been drawn down with creditor approval (including an $800.00 ITSA fee) leaving $1,100.90.A further $2,300.00 (including GST, an ITSA charge of 8% and retransmission of title fees) would be required to complete the administration and secure the issue of the certificate pursuant to s 153A.On 24 February 2004, Ms Townsend issued proceedings.Two further things emerged throughout 2004.First, the trustee indicated he would respond to ITSA and Ms Townsend concerning complaints made and threats to commence various actions (petitions, legal actions, investigations etc) against him and those steps would be treated by the trustee as actions taken in the administration of the estate and, in consequence, a charge upon the estate.Secondly, the cost of responding to the proceedings commenced by Ms Townsend would also represent a charge upon the estate.Accordingly, the costs, charges and expenses of the administration and the remuneration of the trustee in conducting the administration, expanded significantly.The judgments of Federal Magistrate Coker On 24 December 2004, Federal Magistrate Coker published his reasons in relation to orders made on 5 November 2004.The respondent's application in the Federal Magistrates Court relied upon s 153A and s 153B.The contention of the applicant was that by 27 November 2003, the debts of the bankrupt had been paid in full.However, the debts of the bankrupt included the 'costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy including the remuneration of the trustee' (s 153A).Since the controversy, at its centre, involved the question of the content of the steps taken by the trustee and the reasonableness of those steps and the corresponding charges, his Honour directed that the trustee's costs (expenses and remuneration) from the date of the sequestration order on 20 June 2003 to 5 November 2004 be taxed.His Honour accepted that the applicant had expressed an ongoing requirement for taxation of the costs (including the remuneration of the trustee).His Honour made these observations:I have made a passing comment in relation to the costs and the increasing significance of those costs.This is particularly the case when one considers that the liabilities that were needed to be met in relation to the matter are, in fact, less than the costs that have now been charged.It would be inappropriate, however, for me to make any comment in relation to whether those costs are, or are not, proper, particularly when there is to be a taxation in relation to same and I would specifically decline to make any comment in relation to those costs.It would seem that if the issue of costs is able to be resolved, no matter what the outcome, then it is clear that, pursuant to section 153A, the applicant would be entitled to annulment of the bankruptcy.The trustee acknowledged during the course of the hearing that the debts other than the issue of costs had been clearly resolved as between the parties and it would seem that resolution of that particular aspect of the matter in relation to costs should then bring the matter to an end.As to the treatment of the collateral proceedings, his Honour said this: The trustee raises a concern in respect of the possibility of the some other proceedings, be it a personal prosecution, referral to Parliament or whatever, and obviously the applicant cannot be told what she can or cannot do other than to say that I would think that there would be significant further expense incurred by her in relation to proceedings and one would have to be giving serious consideration to the wise action in relation to the matter being simply to bring proceedings to an end'.His Honour considered aspects of the application made pursuant to s 153B of the Act but took the view that the proper course was to order taxation of the costs on the footing that a resolution of the reasonableness of the costs would facilitate an annulment of the bankruptcy pursuant to s 153A of the Act.His Honour made this observation:I am satisfied that the proper course to follow in relation to this matter is taxation and a resolution pursuant to the provisions of s 153A.I do not, for a moment, find that the trustee has acted in any way that might be suggested to be malicious or vexatious but that he has acted in a proper manner in relation to the matter.What I would also say, however, is that I gave the distinct impression, particularly in material read and more particularly perhaps from seeing both the applicant and the trustee, that there is a degree of distrust or lack of confidence that each might have in the other in relation to services provided by the trustee, and the actions that might or might not be contemplated by the applicant, such that they are unable to fully resolve what should happen in relation to this proceeding.His Honour further observes:However if that [resolution of the costs and the issue of an annulment certificate] is not agreed, for one reason or the other, then it would seem to me appropriate that the court should determine the application by the applicant.It may be that the sequestration order has already been annulled as a result of the taxation and resolution.If not, I will give consideration to whether it is appropriate for any direction to be given pursuant to section 153A or whether the application should be dismissed.On 10 December 2004, the trustee submitted a Bill of Costs to the ITSA taxing officer for assessment.Mr Laurie, counsel acting for Ms Townsend, on 11 January 2005, made written submissions to ITSA in relation to the Bill of Costs which addressed six categories of costs within the bill.On 28 January 2005, the taxing officer issued a provisional assessment and on 4 February 2005 a final assessment was issued to the parties.A detailed Bill of Costs was submitted for work carried out between 20 June 2003 and 5 November 2004 totalling $40,328.80 subject to the addition of GST.The taxing officer considered the extensive objections made by Mr Laurie and set out an assessment having regard to the six categories of challenge.The first category concerned work done in the ordinary course of the administration up to and including 9 January 2004.Mr Laurie contended that by that date all creditors had been paid and the trustee had received $10,000.00 in satisfaction of costs, charges, expenses and remuneration.The bankrupt contended that by that date, an annulment certificate ought to have issued.The taxing officer allowed as a fair and reasonable amount for that period, the sum of $9,491.46 made up of outlays of $766.10 and fees of $8,725.36.GST and the 8% realisation charge were not included in that sum.The second category identified by Mr Laurie was an assessment of the fair and reasonable costs relating to work carried out up to the date of Ms Townsend's annulment application to the court dated 16 February 2004 but filed on 24 February 2004.The total amount allowed as fair and reasonable constituted $10,438.20 comprising $770.40 outlays and $9,667.83 as fees subject to the addition of GST and the 8% realisation charge.The third category of analysis involved the fair and reasonable costs relating to the opposition by the trustee to the annulment application and various attendances at court.The total amount allowed as a fair and reasonable claim constitute $24,844.60 comprising outlays of $4,042.27 and $20,802.37 fees subject to the addition of GST and an 8% realisation charge.The fourth category involved the fair and reasonable costs of dealing with complaints lodged by Ms Townsend with bankruptcy regulators.The taxing officer allowed an amount of $523.42 subject to the addition of GST and an 8% realisation charge.The fifth category involved a contention that the balance of costs incurred in the administration of the estate were entirely unnecessary including attending to ordinary matters of the administration because at the time the costs were incurred an annulment ought to have been granted and in addition, concern was expressed about the level of charges and the amount of time spent in the ordinary administration.Ms Townsend relied upon the general discretion of the taxing officer in determining a proper charge for the various matters and requested the taxing officer to identify an amount which related to the ordinary administration of the estate from the date of the order of Federal Magistrate Coker until the date of assessment of the costs.Mr Laurie identified a series of items the subject of specific inquiry.In respect of all of those items but for three (items 308, 440 and 442), the taxing officer considered that the work performed by the trustee involved responding to Ms Townsend's annulment application and accepted the items in the Bill of Costs as fair and reasonable.The sixth category involved an assessment of the costs incurred by the trustee in disputing with ITSA the question of whether the request for taxation was a valid request or not.As to that matter, the taxing officer allowed $1,197.12 subject to the addition of GST and an 8% realisation charge.Accordingly, in respect of the total bill of $40,328.80 plus GST lodged for assessment, the taxing officer disallowed $218.57 having taken account of submissions put to the taxing officer by counsel for the bankrupt.On 9 February 2005, a Certificate of Taxation issued reflecting the assessment.The taxing officer indicated that the interim costs of taxation for 4 February 2005 amounted to $2,760.00.On 8 February 2005, the trustee wrote to Ms Townsend in relation to the taxing officer's assessment of the costs.The trustee said that costs up to 9 January 2004 had been allowed at $9,491.46.The GST component amounted to $949.15 and the ITSA realisation charge constituted $800.00.The total amount to 9 January 2004 therefore represented $11,240.61.In the period 1 July 2003 to December 2003, the trustee had received $10,000.00 and accordingly the trustee contended that total funds received could not have discharged all debts within the meaning of s 153A of the Act.The trustee observed that even if $11,240.61 had been received, further work would be required to issue the certificate, report to creditors and transfer title to the properties to the bankrupt.As to the question of the costs incurred by the trustee in resisting the annulment application, the trustee took the position that it was appropriate to oppose that application because the trustee could not be satisfied that all debts had been paid as contemplated by s 153A.No observation was made in the letter concerning s 153B.Because the trustee could not be satisfied that all the bankrupt's debts had been paid in full by reason of outstanding costs, charges and expenses and an outstanding claim for remuneration, Ms Townsend's application for final relief was determined by Federal Magistrate Coker on 22 April 2005 supported by reasons published on 19 May 2005.The respondent sought an order annulling the bankruptcy on the ground the applicant had paid every creditor in full including the trustee's fees; a declaration that the trustee deliberately contributed to excessive charges; and an order that the trustee is liable in damages to the respondent.The source of the power relied upon by the respondent was s 153A and s 153B.The appellant contended that he was not satisfied of the relevant matters; the court had no power to dispense with the statutory requirement of satisfaction on the part of the trustee; and no proper basis had been identified for an order pursuant to either s 153A or s 153B.His Honour reached these conclusions:his Honour was not satisfied that a declaration could be made that the trustee had deliberately contributed to the imposition of excessive charges [8];his Honour was of the view that 'there is certainly in my view, power to fix a sum in relation to costs in respect of the administration of the estate' [8];it is not possible to make an order pursuant to s 153A or direct the trustee to issue a certificate [10] --- [12];had the financial circumstances of the respondent been properly considered at the time of hearing the creditor's petition, there would have been some consideration given to adjourning the petition [16];the contention that the value of Ms Townsend's assets exceeded her identified liabilities makes it 'clear that the applicant was in a position of solvency'.His Honour relies upon the decisions of Reithmuller FM in Duncan v McVeigh &amp; Anor FMCA 759 and Spender J in Re McDonald; ex parte The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 33 ATR 1.Those decisions, of course, both recognise the importance of an undertaking to pay the costs of the trustee's administration and the need for the court to be satisfied that by reason of any asset surplus, the bankrupt is able to pay his or her debts [17] --- [22];within a short period of time, the debts due to creditors had been paid by the bankrupt and some clarification of the position with regard to securing an annulment was sought [22];during the administration, a fundamental breakdown in the relationship between the trustee and Ms Townsend occurred;at [23], [24] and [25], his Honour quotes extensive passages from the trustee's letter dated 10 February 2004 to Ms Townsend and in reliance upon, at least in part, those passages, his Honour concludes that: 'it is most disturbing that a certificate has not issued pursuant to s 153A notwithstanding that the creditors have been paid [26] ; the trustee's position is that it is impossible to issue a certificate whilst the possibility of a private prosecution or complaint remains outstanding [26] ; the actions of the trustee are unprofessional [27] '; and as an apparent explanation of that conclusion, his Honour says the proper course on the part of the trustee 'would have been to bring the matter to a prompt finalisation' [27] and that result was not reached because the approaches by the applicant 'to a serious extent were unable to be dealt with as a result of the trustee's very determined efforts to ensure that no complaint could be brought in relation to the conduct by him of the administration' [27] ; the trustee by reason of the letter of 10 February 2004 'quite obviously' attempted to 'force any consideration by the applicant of the proceedings now before the court, not to be brought because of the financial influence and effect of those proceedings' [28].extremely excessive costs have been incurred as a result of the failure to bring this matter to a successful conclusion' [29]; andAt [29] and [30], these observations: I am concerned as to further costs being incurred in relation to these proceedings and to what I consider to have been extremely excessive charges incurred, as a result of the failure to bring this matter to a successful conclusion.I am mindful of the terms of the letter of 10 February 2004 and, in particular, the indications as to costs expended and expectations in relation to future to costs.In my view, that was the appropriate time to bring this matter to an end.To suggest that the bankruptcy could never be annulled whilst there was some possibility of a disgruntled client complaining as to the administration of the estate, is bullying in the extreme and is inappropriate.I intend to fix the trustee's costs in relation to the administration of the estate at $15,000.00 taking into consideration the amounts already paid and the estimates contained within the correspondence of 10 February 2004.His Honour concluded that the respondent was then and at all times solvent and the proper course was to annul the bankruptcy pursuant to s 153B of the Act.The immediate difficulty with his Honour's conclusions and findings is that they do not arise out of an exposed analysis of the evidence no doubt because his Honour was seeking to expeditiously dispose of a controversy with a long history.However, there are two reasons on the evidence why the trustee had refused to reach a state of satisfaction required by s 153A of the Act.The first was that notwithstanding the payment of $10,000.00 by Ms Townsend (or those assisting her) having regard to the letters of 25 November 2003 (see [33], [34] and [35]), 27 November 2003 [36], 28 November 2003 [37] and 10 February 2004 [41], a further amount as at 10 February 2004 of $2,300.00 would be required to meet the cost of work undertaken from 13 December 2003 to that date and the additional tasks necessary to finalise the administration.The second consideration involved the question of whether further costs would be incurred by the trustee in responding to complaints and allegations and a threatened private prosecution or other proceedings.As to the first reason, the trustee on 10 February 2004 said that remuneration for work done from 13 December 2003 (having regard to the fact that the report to creditors was dated 12 December 2003 and the completion of the earlier billing period was 11 December 2003) was approximately $1,300.00 (plus GST), plus $580.00 for expenses (plus GST); that is, approximately $2,068.00.The trustee suggested a further amount of $2,200.00 would fairly represent the value of that work.In addition, further identified steps to complete the administration would be necessary (see paragraph 3 of the letter of 10 February 2004 [41]).The trustee said in the letter of 10 February 2004 that he held $1,100.90 (being the $10,000.00 received, less remuneration of $8,099.10 and less the 8% ITSA realisation fee of $800.00) and upon receipt of a further $2,300.00 (including GST, the Government charges on re-transmitting Ms Townsend's land and the 8% ITSA charge) the trustee 'could draw down all or the major part of the cost to complete, prepare or lodge any land transfer forms and issue an annulment certificate under s 153A of the Bankruptcy Act )' .In other words, a total amount of $3,400.90 would complete the administration, satisfy all relevant costs, charges, expenses and remuneration and result in an annulment certificate.Having regard to the $10,000.00 already paid and its application, the additional $2,300.00 would result in an annulment certificate based upon costs, charges, expenses and remuneration (including GST, Government charges and ITSA charges) of $12,300.00, in all.Ms Townsend refused to pay any further contribution and on 24 February 2004 filed the application the subject of these proceedings.Had Ms Townsend on or about 10 February 2004 paid a further amount of $2,300.00 to the trustee, consistent with the request made in the letter of 10 February 2004, the inference clearly open on the material is that the administration would have been finalised on the terms of the letter with an annulment certificate issuing pursuant to s 153A of the Act.However, Ms Townsend was plainly of the view that the request for the further monies was both unnecessary and unreasonable and accordingly she sought to test, in effect, the request by placing the matter before the court framed by the orders sought in the application.As a result of the taxation of the trustee's Bill of Costs pursuant to the order of Federal Magistrate Coker on 5 November 2004, an objective basis for an assessment of whether the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration of the trustee constituted fair and reasonable fees emerged.The comparative position to 10 February 2004 consistent with the taxation is this:Fees $9,674.71 GST $954.22 Sub-total $10,628.93 Plus ITSA Charge $800.00 Sub-total $11,428.93 Plus Outlays (including GST) $832.79 TOTAL $12,261.72 Accordingly, having regard to the independent assessment of the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration which was undertaken expressly on the basis that all complaints relating to the conduct of the trustee would be put before the taxing officer, the amount payable to 10 February 2004 would have been $12,261.72 as compared with the amount the trustee was seeking to complete the administration of $12,300.00.The trustee's assessment included an estimate of the costs to undertake the additional steps to complete the administration whereas the assessed fees and outlays represented simply the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration to 10 February 2004.Two things flow from this evidence.The first is that his Honour did not have regard to the legitimacy of the expenses incurred by the trustee that the trustee was entitled to recover and accordingly no obligation arose in the trustee to issue a certificate pursuant to s 153A on or about 10 February 2004.Secondly, having regard to the objective assessment of the costs taking into consideration the extensive submissions made by Mr Laurie on behalf of Ms Townsend, a conclusion is not open on the evidence that the costs were 'extremely excessive'.The costs since 10 February 2004 have, of course, become extensive but those costs flow from an election by Ms Townsend to contest by litigation the legitimacy of the fees sought by the trustee on or about 10 February 2004.The costs estimated by the trustee on 10 February 2004, having regard to the objective evidence of the assessment, reveals that the costs are both the actual costs and those costs considered by an assessor to be fair and reasonable.Plainly enough, Ms Townsend had a perception that the costs should be much lower and had agitated that complaint in various quarters.Ms Townsend had offered the trustee an amount of $4,500.00 at an earlier time against the background of her assessment that the costs ought to be $3,000.00.The trustee had rejected Ms Townsend's assessment of those matters.On 8 December 2003, Ms Townsend continued to assert to ITSA that the costs should only be $3,000.00.Ms Townsend's view that the costs were excessive continued to be held and was, no doubt, the reason for contesting the request for the further funds by electing to file the court application on 24 February 2004.However, it is not open on the evidence to conclude, as his Honour did, that the administration of the estate ought to have been finalised by the trustee on or about 10 February 2004 and the failure to do so represented unprofessional conduct.The trustee identified the value of the costs, charges and expenses and remuneration required to bring the estate to a conclusion but Ms Townsend was of the view, no doubt in her own mind a reasonably held view, that the request for further funds was unreasonable.The trustee could have simply abandoned any claim for further monies and assumed an obligation to complete the administration and accept as consideration for the administration of the estate, the amount of $10,000.00 previously paid to the trustee in the context of the earlier letters.However, the trustee could not be directed to adopt that position and was entitled to properly identify the field of costs, charges, expenses and remuneration, make an informed assessment of the costs and require payment of the costs (see s 162 of the Act and Division 4 of the Bankruptcy Regulations ; Mayne v Jaques (1959 --- 1960) [1960] HCA 23 ; 101 CLR 169; Re Wong ex parte Wong v Donnelly (1995) 63 FCR 426).The only basis upon which the trustee could have brought the administration to completion on or about 10 February 2004 was by accepting Ms Townsend's contention that no further fees ought to be paid.His Honour's conclusions on these matters are unsupported by the evidence.The independent taxation of the Bill of Costs demonstrates that across the period of the bill an amount of only $218.57 was taxed off the amount of the bill as delivered by the trustee, namely, $40,328.90.The exercise of the discretion by his Honour miscarried because his Honour failed to have regard to the burden of the evidence.The findings that his Honour made of unprofessional conduct and the incurring of extremely excessive charges cannot stand in the face of the evidence and the precise chronology of events.In assessing the material comprised in the Appeal Book, I have considered in real detail the draft bills of account submitted by the trustee and the detail of the Bill of Costs as delivered.His Honour's reasons do not identify a sequence of charges or item numbers which are said to represent the class or categories of excessive costs or charges.An assessment of the bill does not readily convey an impression that the items are not matters which a trustee would encounter in the course of the administration of an estate.Having said that however, it seems to me that in the absence of disallowance by the taxing officer of a significant number of items on the articulated ground that the particular items were unnecessary and thus the charges excessive, it is not open to conclude that the fees and outlays were extremely excessive.The second reason upon which the trustee relied in failing to be satisfied that an annulment certificate could issue concerned the potential costs, charges and expenses and remuneration which might be incurred in responding to complaints and allegations made by Ms Townsend in various forums.The trustee's letter of 10 February 2004 proceeded on the footing that the trustee would not find it necessary to respond to complaints and that such matters would not continue to be agitated at least in the context of a continuing administration.Ms Townsend seems, on the evidence, to have accepted that particular complaints would not be agitated as previously suggested.Ms Townsend did agitate matters further with ITSA and particularly with a view to attempting to secure a replacement of the trustee but those matters were agitated in the context of the continuing costs of the administration particularly having regard to the costs incurred in connection with the application to the court, among other matters.His Honour concluded that the matters set out in the final five paragraphs of the letter of 10 February 2004 (as set out at [41]) represented an attempt to force any consideration of Ms Townsend's application to the court to be brought to an end and represented the expression of extreme and inappropriate bullying.Those conclusions cannot stand in the face of the evidence for a number of reasons.First, Ms Townsend had indicated that her disposition was not to press complaints so as to facilitate the resolution of the administration and accordingly the formulation of the costs at 10 February 2004 by the trustee of an additional $2,300.00 recognised that no costs would be incurred in the administration in connection with any matters of complaint.Had those monies been paid, a s 153A certificate would have duly issued effecting an annulment.Secondly, although the response of the trustee to the allegations of complaint might be regarded as robust, the trustee was nevertheless entitled to respond to complaints which he perceived to be misconceived and unmeritorious either because the assessment by the bankrupt of the reasonableness of proposed fees was not founded upon any proper basis or because allegations of abuses were not, in the trustee's view, correct (see Bellin v Pattison (Trustee) [1999] FCA 51 at [18] to [22]).A bankrupt concerned about the conduct of a trustee might invoke an inquiry into the conduct of the trustee pursuant to s 179 and seek to bring the scope of the trustee's conduct within the supervision of the court.In undertaking such an inquiry, the court might form a view that particular conduct involved a breach of duty and make an order that the trustee be removed from office or make an order disentitling the trustee to an indemnity out of the estate assets in respect of any costs, charges and expenses incurred in breach of duty or an order disentitling the trustee to particular remuneration.The proceedings before Federal Magistrate Coker sought an annulment of the bankruptcy on the ground that all debts of the bankrupt had been paid and that s 153A of the Act conferred a power upon the court to annul the bankruptcy.Secondly, the respondent contended that because the sequestration order ought not to have been made, the bankruptcy ought to be annulled.No challenge was made to the conduct of the trustee in reliance upon a power in the court to 'inquire into the conduct of the trustee' for the purposes of s 179 of the Act.I accept the submission of the appellant that the relief sought and the foundation for the relief was directed to annulment of the bankruptcy arising out of the contended discharge of all debts of the bankrupt and a contention that the sequestration order ought not to have been made.The application did not proceed nor was it conducted on the footing that the court was conducting an inquiry into the conduct of the trustee.The first aspect of the application involved an order by his Honour that the costs (both expenses and remuneration) of the trustee be taxed to determine the body of fair and reasonable costs in the expectation that a resolution of that matter would, in all probability, result in a position where a certificate might issue thus annulling the bankruptcy by operation of s 153A of the Act.Within the forum of the taxation of the costs, the conduct of the trustee both in terms of the steps taken by him and his staff and the charges allocated for those steps was to be the subject of examination.The proceeding before the court was not, however, an inquiry for the purposes of s 179 of the Act and it is not now appropriate to determine the questions on appeal on the footing of s 179.A third reason why the conclusions reached by his Honour concerning the position adopted by the trustee in relation to existing and future complaints by Ms Townsend cannot stand is that the trustee put the proposition that Ms Townsend might consider withdrawing threats of action or complaint expressly on the basis that if they were to be pursued, the trustee might either apply to the court for a release or, alternatively, apply to the court for directions as to how the allegations might be dealt with.In addition, the trustee recommended that if Ms Townsend thought the suggestion of the trustee that a private prosecution might not be pursued was, in the circumstances, an 'improper suggestion', Ms Townsend may choose to seek legal advice specifically on that matter.The assessment of the costs incurred by the trustee reveal that in the period from 20 June 2003 to 5 November 2004 the costs of dealing with complaints lodged by Ms Townsend with bankruptcy regulators amounted to $523.42 subject to the addition of GST and an 8% realisation charge.His Honour relied upon s 153B in making an order annulling the bankruptcy and setting aside the sequestration order based upon a finding that Ms Townsend was at the date of the sequestration order solvent and at all material times remained solvent.Section 154 provides that all acts done by the trustee or any person acting under the authority of the trustee before the annulment, are taken to have been validly made or done (subject to considerations of breach of duty) and s 154 provides that the trustee may 'apply the property of the former bankrupt still vested in the trustee in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy, including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee'.His Honour made a further order fixing the remuneration of the trustee and concluded that the court certainly had power to 'fix a sum in relation to the costs in respect of the administration of the estate' [8] although the source of that power was not identified.Whatever the source of the power may be, the foundation for the exercise of the power was that the trustee ought to have concluded the administration on or about 10 February 2004 and that having regard to that circumstance, the costs ought to have been $15,000.00.No such foundation existed and the exercise of the power therefore failed.As to the source of the power, it cannot be found in s 153B or any provision of Division 5 of Part VII of the Act.Division 4 of Part VIII of the Act addresses the topic of 'Control over trustees'.Section 178 of the Act within Division 4 contains the heading ' Appeal to court against trustee's decision ' and is in these terms:Right of appeal] If the bankrupt, a creditor or any other person is affected by an act, omission or decision of the trustee, he or she may apply to the court, and the court may make such order in the manner as it thinks just and equitable.Time limit] The application must be made not later than 60 days after the day on which the person became aware of the trustee's act, omission or decision.Plainly enough, the application to the court made by Ms Townsend on 24 February 2004 did not expressly raise the notion of an appeal from a decision of the trustee.Ms Townsend's application was signed on 16 February 2004 and filed on 24 February 2004 within 14 days of the letter from the trustee dated 10 February 2004 seeking a further sum of $2,300.00 in order to bring the administration of the estate to a conclusion and facilitate the issue of a certificate and, in consequence, an annulment of the bankruptcy.Although the precise character of an 'act, omission or decision of the trustee' is not clear, s 178 may well be sufficiently broad in its formulation to confer power upon the court to make such order as the court thinks just and equitable in relation to the request by the trustee for the provision of further monies in respect of costs (both expenses and remuneration) incurred from 13 December 2003 to 10 February 2004 and in respect of those costs to be incurred in undertaking steps necessary to complete the administration.Because his Honour failed to have regard to the evidence, no proper foundation subsisted for the exercise of a power to fix costs.The discretion has miscarried but to the extent that the source of the power might need to be identified, it seems to me that s 178 may well confer a power to determine or fix the quantum of the costs (both expenses and remuneration) in respect of an administration.In addition, s 30 of the Act confers a power upon the court to make such orders as the court considers 'necessary for the purposes of carrying out or giving effect to the Act in any case or matter'.The intersection, however, between the exercise of such powers directed to the subject matter of the trustee's remuneration and the proper application of s 162 of the Act which specifically addresses the mechanisms by which the trustee's remuneration is to be determined, must be carefully considered in any particular case.The trustee's remuneration might be determined by resolution of the creditors or, by a committee of inspection.Where the remuneration of the trustee is not so determined, the trustee is to be remunerated as prescribed by the regulations (s 162).The making of an order to fix or otherwise determine the remuneration of the trustee in the exercise of a power which properly comprehends such subject matter, notwithstanding the preparation of an itemised Bill of Costs and the taxation of those costs, could only arise out of an exposed process of reasoning identifying a proper basis for recourse to such power.There is no such process of exposed reasoning identified.Accordingly, the orders made by Federal Magistrate Coker on 22 April 2005 that 'the costs of the administration of the estate of the applicant including the transfer back to the applicant of any real property, be fixed in the sum of $15,000.00' and that 'there be no order as to costs in relation to the proceedings before this Court' must be set aside.Because the request of the trustee on 10 February 2004 for a further amount of $2,300.00 in order to complete the administration was fair and reasonable having regard to all the evidence with the result that the trustee was entitled to form the view that the debts of the bankrupt had not been fully paid by reason of the controversy concerning the costs, charges, expenses and remuneration of the administration, it necessarily follows that the rejection of that request and the election to commence proceedings is the true source of the additional costs.Before setting out the proposed orders, it should be noted that the matters before Federal Magistrate Coker on 5 November 2004 and subsequently on 15 February 2005 involved a challenge to the refusal of the trustee to issue a certificate for the purposes of s 153A, an examination of the requests by the trustee for the provision of funds in connection with the administration of the estate and a consideration of whether the bankruptcy ought to be annulled pursuant to s 153B.Although Federal Magistrate Coker determined that the bankruptcy ought to be annulled on the ground of the solvency of the applicant, a substantial part of the proceeding involved a consideration of evidence going to the first limb of the application as to whether a certificate ought to have issued on the part of the trustee and whether the court had power to direct an annulment in circumstances where a factual contention that all debts of the bankrupt including the costs (both expenses and remuneration) had been paid by a certain date, was resolved in favour of the applicant.The applicant was successful on the second limb of the application.Accordingly, any costs arising out of or in connection with the hearing which now might be the subject of an order, ought to be limited to those matters arising out of or in connection with the first limb of the application.I propose to make the following orders:The trustee of the estate of Ms Julie-Ann Townsend is entitled to be paid costs, charges of the administration of the bankruptcy including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee on the following basis: for the period 20 June 2003 to 5 November 2004, an amount of $40,110.23 less the amount received in the sum of $15,000.00 plus applicable GST; andfor the period from 5 November 2004 to the date of this order, remuneration of the trustee as determined by operation of s 162 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966  and Bankruptcy Regulations ; and costs, charges and expenses incurred on an indemnity basis.The respondent shall pay to the appellant the sum of $25,110.23 plus applicable GST within 45 days of the date of this order.The respondent shall pay the appellant the amount of the remuneration determined in accordance with order 1 of these orders within 45 days of delivery by the appellant to the respondent of an itemised Bill of Costs or, alternatively, within 14 days of the issuance of a certificate of taxation in the event that the respondent requests such Bill of Costs to be taxed under the provisions of the Act and the Bankruptcy Regulations .The respondent shall pay the appellant the amount of the costs, charges and expenses referred to in order 1 of these orders within 45 days of delivery of an itemised Bill of Costs or alternatively within 14 days of the issuance of a certificate of taxation in the event that the respondent requests such Bill of Costs to be taxed under the provisions of the Act and the Bankruptcy Regulations .The appellant shall be entitled to apply the property of the former bankrupt still vested in the trustee in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy including the remuneration and expenses of the trustee as determined in accordance with these orders.The respondent shall pay the appellant's costs of the hearing in the Federal Magistrates Court limited to those costs of and incidental to the relief sought by the respondent pursuant to s 153A of the Act and the following orders sought by paragraphs 1 and 2 of the respondent's application dated 16 February 2004 and filed on 24 February 2004, namely: ' that the bankruptcy of the applicant be annulled on the grounds that the applicant has paid every creditor in full including trustee's fees; and  a declaration that the trustee has deliberately contributed to the excessive charges imposed on the bankrupt by over administering a very simple estate'.The respondent shall pay the appellant's costs of the appeal.</doc>

Peter John Wilkshire commenced an appeal from a decision of a Delegate of the Registrar of Trade Marks dismissing his opposition to the registration of a trade mark in the name of the respondent, Bombala Shire Council.The appeal was listed for directions at 9.15 am on 27 April 2006.At that stage, the applicant represented himself.The notice of appeal was obviously drafted by a lay person and was not in conventional form.The address for service was ' "Grannys Well", Wilkshire Road Via Delegate NSW 2633'.A notice of appearance was filed by solicitors on behalf of the respondent on 3 April 2006.On 20 April 2006 the respondent filed a notice of motion seeking the striking out of a number of grounds in the notice of appeal and an order that 'the applicant file and serve within 14 days of this order a statement which identifies with precision the grounds on which the respondent's application for registration is opposed'.The motion was supported by an affidavit of a solicitor sworn on 19 April 2006.The only substantive matter in that affidavit was as follows: Notice of Appeal includes various grounds relating to issues of alleged bias and collusion which the Respondent considers to be irrelevant to the matters before the Court on the appeal.On behalf of the Respondent, I request that the Court make orders sought by the Respondent in the Respondent's Notice of Motion dated 18 April 2006.The notice of motion was made returnable at 10.15 am on 27 April 2006.On 26 April 2006 a notice of appointment of solicitor was filed on behalf of the applicant.On that day, the Court was presented in chambers with consent short minutes of order signed by the solicitors for the parties as follows: If not filed and served beforehand, the applicant file and serve a notice of appointment of solicitor by 4pm on 27 April 2006.The applicant serve on the respondent a draft amended notice of appeal on or before 18 May 2006.The respondent indicate to the applicant whether it consents to the filing of the proposed amended notice of appeal on or before 25 May 2006.The proceeding, including the respondent's notice of motion filed on 20 April 2006, be stood over to 9.15 am 1 st June 2006.Those orders were made in chambers on 26 April 2006 and the listings for the following day were vacated.The matter has proceeded in the normal way since this time, the applicant having filed an amended notice of appeal in substantially different form from the original notice of appeal.The respondent's notice of motion became otiose.It was agreed that the costs of the motion be dealt with on the basis of written submissions.Those submissions have been provided.There are factual issues as to what occurred between the filing of the motion and 26 April 2006, including service or attempted service on the one hand, and what was done by the applicant by way of instructing a solicitor on the other.If it were necessary to resolve those issues, evidence would be required.In my opinion, it is not necessary to resolve those issues.On the one hand, it is clear enough that the applicant must bear and pay the costs occasioned by the filing of an inappropriately framed notice of appeal.On the other hand, it is clear enough that the filing of a motion was premature.The proceeding was listed for first directions within days of the filing of the motion.That is normally the occasion to raise procedural issues.Warning of such issues should normally be given by correspondence prior to that directions hearing.There may be circumstances where it would be appropriate to bring on a motion to stay or strike out proceedings returnable at the first directions hearing --- for example, if the proceeding was fundamentally misconceived.Even in that case, it would be unusual for such a motion to be heard and determined on the first directions hearing.This was not such a case.Further, the affidavit in support of the motion does not indicate that any prior notice of the defects alleged had been given to the applicant.Although it is not critical to this decision, it is to be noted that there is no evidence that service occurred sufficient to entitle the respondent to proceed with the motion on 27 April 2006.It follows, in my opinion, that the respondent is not entitled to its costs of the motion and the applicant should have his costs of the argument about costs.On the other hand, the applicant caused the initial difficulty by filing an inappropriate form of notice of appeal.The applicant is not entitled to costs connected with that and the respondent is entitled to its costs incurred by that circumstance.The respondent's costs would be limited because of the prompt acquiescence by the solicitor for the applicant in the necessity to replead.In my opinion, the entitlements to costs on either side effectively cancel each other out.The respondent should bear its own costs of and concerning the preparation of and filing of the motion filed on 20 April 2006 and the affidavit in support, any costs associated with service or attempted service thereof and of the argument as to costs of the motion.The applicant should bear his own costs up to and including 27 April 2006.Other costs of the parties to date will be costs in the proceeding.</doc>

notewhether credible, significant and relevant to the reviewrelevant to credibilityno adverse findings in respect of credibilitywhether provision of the file note could have made any difference to the resultmigrationThe applicant, a citizen of Libya, challenges the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal delivered on 7 January 1999 in which the Tribunal determined that the applicant was not entitled to a protection visa under the Migration Act 1958  ('the Migration Act ').That decision affirmed the decision of a delegate of the first respondent made on 9 December 1997.The applicant was a member of the Lie class action in the High Court (see Muin v Refugee Review Tribunal [2002] HCA 30 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 966).Pursuant to orders made in those proceedings, the applicant filed a draft order nisi in the High Court on 13 June 2003 seeking that the Tribunal's decision be quashed.The ground upon which relief was claimed in the draft order nisi is stated as follows: the First Respondent failed to afford the Applicant/Prosecutor natural justice because the Applicant/Prosecutor had not been given an opportunity or an adequate opportunity to prepare and present favourable material at hearing or an adequate opportunity to respond to unfavourable material.The High Court proceedings were remitted to this Court.On 23 March 2006 Allsop J determined that the applicant's submissions raised issues which ' may be considered arguable ' and determined that the matter be set down for directions.At directions on 18 April 2006, his Honour declined to make an order under O 51A r 5 and accordingly these proceedings will also determine whether any order nisi should be made absolute.This appeal was heard on 27 July 2006 and on that day was adjourned to 17 August 2006 to afford the applicant an opportunity to tender the transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal.BACKGROUND The applicant was born on 28 April 1967 at Benghazi.He is a Muslim whose parents and siblings (other than one brother) remain in Libya.He was educated at the Garyounis University and graduated in July 1989 with a degree in electrical engineering.After initial employment by an electrical company and by an oil company he joined the Garyounis University Engineering Department as a demonstrator and was ultimately appointed to the staff of the department.The applicant visited Australia for two months in 1995 as a tourist.He visited Australia for a second time on 24 August 1996 and on 31 October 1996 lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('the Department').The application was refused.The applicant claimed that he feared persecution in Libya because of his religion and political opinion.The applicant said that the Libyan government was ' against Islam '.He said that devout Muslims were persecuted by the Government in Libya because of suspicions that they may be involved in anti-government activities undertaken by Islamic fundamentalist groups.The applicant said that he had been detained and questioned on two occasions.He said that he was frequently followed by government agents, that many of his brothers and cousins had been imprisoned by the government, and that several of his co-workers at the university had been arrested.The Tribunal accepted the evidence of the applicant concerning his background and education.The Tribunal also accepted his claim that he had been followed on a number of occasions and that he may have been questioned and detained in 1995.The Tribunal referred to independent country information which stated that the Libyan government continued to act harshly to suppress militant Islamic opposition, and that individuals were arrested and detained if they were suspected of supporting or participating in such activity.The Tribunal also found that it was possible that many ordinary Muslims, unconnected with militant groups, might be arrested and investigated as part of the investigation into the suspected militant activity, and that this may have led to the episodes of questioning which the applicant alleged.However the Tribunal considered that the evidence did not support a finding that the Libyan authorities suspected the applicant of being an Islamic militant.The Tribunal did not believe that the applicant would have been released so quickly on the two occasions when he was arrested, or that he would not have been detained again, if he remained under suspicion of being a militant Islamist.In respect of the applicant's brothers and cousins who had been detained, the Tribunal noted country information which stated that relatives of suspected opponents of the regime could be harassed and detained.However, the Tribunal considered there was insufficient information for it to determine the reasons for the detention of the applicant's relatives.It noted the length of time in between the first time one of his brothers was arrested in 1986 and the limited period and severity of the later detention of the applicant.It was not satisfied that the applicant would face harm on his return to Libya because of his religion on the basis of the experiences of his relatives and friends.In respect of persecution on the basis of his political opinion, the applicant claimed that he is an opponent of the Libyan government.He said he disagreed with the policies of the regime in part because they do not reflect Islam.The Tribunal accepted that the applicant did not support the Libyan regime, but observed that holding political opinions different from the government was not in itself a ground for claiming refugee status.APPLICANT'S CHALLENGES The applicant makes three challenges to the decision of the Tribunal.Firstly, he submits that he was denied procedural fairness because he was not made aware of the country information in the possession of the Tribunal.He says that if he had been made aware he would have made further submissions and submitted additional material of his own.Secondly, the applicant submits that he was denied procedural fairness because the Tribunal's decision was published on its website with such particularity that it identified the applicant.The applicant claims that such publication breached s 431 of the Migration Act .Thirdly, the applicant claims that he was denied procedural fairness because he was not provided with a Departmental file note which was before the Tribunal.The note referred to information provided to the Department by the applicant's brother, who is also an applicant for a protection visa.The file note recorded that the information provided by the applicant's brother (also an applicant for a protection visa) was inconsistent with the information the applicant had provided to the Department.ALLEGED FAILURE TO PROVIDE COUNTRY INFORMATION The applicant claims that he was denied procedural fairness because the Tribunal had in its possession country information which contained details of arrests of professionals which occurred in Libya in 1998.The applicant says that had he been provided with this information he could have informed the Tribunal of his close association with some of those persons.The applicant says that he indicated to the Tribunal that one of his work colleagues, Dr Rajab, had been arrested.He says that some of the independent country information before the Tribunal referred to the wave of arrests in which Dr Rajab was arrested (although Dr Rajab was not mentioned specifically by name in the material before the Tribunal), and if the Tribunal had drawn this information to his attention, he could have explained his association with those whose persecution by the Libyan regime was independently documented.The obligations of the Tribunal are to be determined by reference to the Migration Act as it existed on 7 January 1999, the date of its decision.The Migration Act did not then include s 422B , which provides that Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act (which relates to the conduct of the Tribunal's review) is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the natural justice hearing rule.It is clear that s 422B of the Migration Act now operates to exclude the requirement for decision-makers to abide by common law principles of procedural fairness: see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61.However, it is equally clear from decisions of the High Court that common law principles of procedural fairness were not excluded from the Migration Act as it existed prior to the enactment of s 422B: see Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2 ; (2003) 211 CLR 476 at [37] - [38] per Gleeson CJ; at [83] per Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ; Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Anor; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 at [26] per Gleeson CJ and Hayne J; at [95] per Gaudron J; at [128] per McHugh J; at [188] per Kirby J.Accordingly, it is open to the applicant to raise a breach of common law procedural fairness.The content of procedural fairness requirements will depend upon the circumstances of the exercise of the power: see Wilson J in Kioa and Ors v West and Anor [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 584-5 per Mason J; 601 per Wilson J; 611-2 per Brennan J; 633 per Deane J.However, common law procedural fairness will generally require that an applicant be given the opportunity to comment upon information held by the Tribunal which is adverse to his or her interest.As Mason J said in Kioa at 582: It is a fundamental rule of the common law doctrine of natural justice expressed in traditional terms that, generally speaking, when an order is to be made which will deprive a person of some right or interest or the legitimate expectation of a benefit, he is entitled to know the case sought to be made against him and to be given an opportunity of replying to it ...' Nonetheless, it is not always necessary for the Tribunal to provide to an applicant copies of any country information upon which it relies.The Tribunal's obligations may be discharged if it provides to the applicant orally the substance of adverse material: see NAVM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 99 at [31] ---[33].The important element is that the information provided by the Tribunal enables a person to make a submission concerning its relevance or to adduce competing material.In the present case, it is apparent from the transcript that the Tribunal discussed the independent country information at some length with the applicant.In particular, it raised its concerns that the independent country information did not support the contention that the Libyan government persecuted devout Muslims who were not fundamentalists.In my opinion, the applicant clearly was provided with the substance of the information which was contained in independent country information.The applicant suggests that the Tribunal should have drawn his attention to specific passages in the independent country information.It was submitted that those passages were directly related to the applicant's experiences and, had he been able to explain his relationship with those events, the Tribunal would have assessed his risk of persecution differently.This submission must fail.It is not the function of the Tribunal to establish the applicant's case for him.As Gummow and Hayne JJ observed in Abebe v The Commonwealth of Australia [1999] HCA 14 ; (1999) 197 CLR 510 at 576 [187] : The proceedings before the Tribunal are inquisitorial and the Tribunal is not in the position of a contradictor.It is for the applicant to advance whatever evidence or argument she wishes to advance in support of her contention that she has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason.The Tribunal must then decide whether that claim is made out.The applicant was obliged to raise all of the factual matters which were relevant to his case.That included providing the Tribunal with sufficient details of his personal experiences to allow the Tribunal to make an assessment of his claim.The Tribunal could not have known whether the independent country information referred to arrests of people close to the applicant (such as Dr Rajab) unless the applicant provided specific details of his associates which would enable the Tribunal to recognise circumstances referred to in the country information.The applicant raised the arrests of university colleagues only briefly and vaguely, and did not provide any particular information.If the applicant had additional material which he wished to place before the Tribunal then it was incumbent upon him to place it before the Tribunal.Furthermore, the vast majority of the independent country information which was relied upon by the Tribunal had in fact been provided by the applicant himself, and following the Tribunal hearing, the applicant was offered the opportunity to provide further information.The applicant took up the offer and provided further independent country information to the Tribunal.It is clear that the applicant was not only afforded the opportunity but also exercised his right to comment before the Tribunal.The applicant suggested that the Tribunal and the applicant had been communicating at cross-purposes, because the applicant would, by virtue of his religious practices, be considered a fundamentalist by the regime, despite the fact that he did not consider himself to be a fundamentalist.However, I do not think that this submission truly alleges procedural unfairness, but goes rather to the merits of the Tribunal's decision, which are not reviewable in this Court.In any event, the decision of the Tribunal clearly considered the possibility that innocent civilians could be ' caught up in waves of arrests and in investigations into suspected militant activity '.The Tribunal considered that the applicant's own brief periods of detention may have resulted from such a cause.However, given the brevity of his arrests and the fact that he had not been detained again, the Tribunal considered that the authorities did not continue to suspect him of involvement with Islamic opposition groups.The Tribunal clearly gave the applicant an opportunity to respond to the independent country information and to provide additional information.It then decided that the independent country information did not support the proposition that the Libyan government persecuted individuals solely because they were devout Muslims.It was a factual finding which was open to the Tribunal, and the Tribunal clearly afforded the applicant procedural fairness in relation to this finding.Accordingly, this ground must be rejected.PUBLICATION OF DECISION The applicant submits that the scheme for the publication of decisions pursuant to s 431 of the Migration Act was not followed.At the date of the Tribunal's decision, s 431 of the Migration Act provided: Subject to subsection , and to any direction under section 440 , the Registrar must ensure that statements prepared by the Tribunal in accordance with subsection 430 are published.The Tribunal must not publish any statement which may identify an applicant or any relative or other dependent of an applicant.The applicant says that the version of the Tribunal's reasons for decision which was published on the internet enabled him to be identified, because of the small number of Libyans in Australia and the details provided of the applicant.The applicant also says that a Libyan friend mentioned to the applicant that he had seen his information on the internet.The published judgment provides details of the applicant's country of origin; his religion; the year in which he left school; the year in which he gained employment; the fact that he was interrogated twice; the fact that he was required to sign an undertaking that he would not go to a mosque or see certain people, including one person who was imprisoned in 1997; that he returned to Libya in 1997; and that his relatives had been imprisoned.I note that following the request of the applicant, the Tribunal decision was removed from the website.The respondent does not acknowledge that the Tribunal's decision, as published on the internet, contained any statement which might identify the applicant.In view of the findings hereunder, it is not necessary for me to determine whether the applicant could in fact have been identified from these matters.However, I accept that, despite the fact that much of the more detailed material was removed from the Tribunal's reasons before publication of the decision, there is a possibility that the applicant could have been identified from the remaining material.The applicant submits that the failure to comply with s 431 of the Migration Act gives rise to procedural unfairness.He submits that procedural fairness arises at the pre-hearing stage of the Tribunal hearing and continues during and beyond the hearing and until the Tribunal fulfils its statutory functions by the provisions and publication of its decision.He claims the Tribunal's decision was vitiated by its failure to afford him procedural fairness.The applicant relies upon Ainsworth and Anor v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 and Johns v Australian Securities Commission and Ors [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 as authority for the proposition that procedural fairness may require an opportunity to oppose publication of a decision.I do not accept this submission.The obligations of procedural fairness at common law relate to two 'rules': the bias rule and the hearing rule: see M Aronson, B Dyer and M Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action , 3 rd ed, Lawbook Co, 2004 at 370.The bias rule prevents a Tribunal from acting in a way which shows actual or apprehended bias towards an applicant.The hearing rule acts to ensure that an individual is given an opportunity to be heard before a decision is taken and to meet the case which is put against him or her: see the passage in Kioa cited at [19] above.The precise content of the hearing rule is dependent upon the context in which the decision is being made.In any event, if an allegation of procedural fairness is to be made out, the applicant must demonstrate that either the bias rule or the hearing rule has been breached by the Tribunal.The decision of the Tribunal to publish its reasons upon the internet, in the form in which it did so, could not vitiate the decision which had already been made by the Tribunal relating to the applicant's refugee status.No suggestion has been made that the Tribunal's decision to publish its reasons indicated bias on the part of the Tribunal.Nor is there any suggestion that the hearing given by the Tribunal had been in some way deficient.If a breach of neither of these principles is alleged, a claim of procedural unfairness is not made out.The applicant's reliance on Ainsworth is misplaced.In that case, the Criminal Justice Commission published a report which made adverse factual findings against Ainsworth, in circumstances where Ainsworth had never been given the opportunity to be heard upon the basis for those findings.The report attracted a duty of procedural fairness because its contents had the potential to ' destroy, defeat or prejudice a person's rights, interests or legitimate expectations ' (see Annetts and Anor v McCann and Ors [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ).In contrast, in these proceedings the applicant was given an opportunity to be heard upon the findings which were included in the Tribunal's decision.The Tribunal had invited the applicant to a hearing, which he attended.Accordingly the Tribunal's duty of procedural fairness was discharged in respect of the factual and legal findings which it made in that decision, and ultimately its decision that the applicant was not a refugee.Johns concerns a decision by the Australian Securities Commission to allow transcript of interviews it had conducted with the appellant to be released to the public.In that case, the High Court held that the applicant ought to have been given an opportunity to make submissions before that decision was made and accordingly it was invalid.On this basis the applicant says that the Tribunal's decision to publish its reasons was also a decision which is reviewable.I accept that the decision by the Tribunal to publish its reasons on the internet in the form which it did was a decision which might be challenged.Indeed, after a request by the applicant, the Tribunal removed the reasons from the internet.If the Tribunal had refused to remove its reasons from the internet, it may have been open to the applicant to challenge that decision and seek injunctive relief to restrain the continued publication on the basis that it was inappropriate for the Tribunal to have published its reasons without giving the applicant an opportunity to make submissions about the details which should not be published.That is, the applicant might have successfully made an allegation that procedural fairness had been denied in relation to the decision to publish .However, any errors which may have occurred in the Tribunal's decision to publish were incapable of affecting its decision on the applicant's refugee status, which had been concluded before publication and in respect of which fair procedures had been observed.It follows that this ground of challenge must be rejected.FAILURE TO DISCLOSE FILE NOTE The applicant's third challenge to the decision relates to the failure of the Tribunal to disclose to the applicant a file note dated 29 April 1998 and made by an officer of the Department, which was provided to the Tribunal.The file note referred to inconsistencies between the applicant's application for a protection visa and that of his brother, whose application for a protection visa was also being determined by the Department.The file note contains information which is potentially adverse to the applicant, in that it suggests the account provided by him is inconsistent with the account provided by his brother.It also incorrectly summarises the information contained in the applicant's protection visa application, stating that he claimed only one brother was detained by authorities, when in fact his application states that the Libyan government ' jailed many of my brothers and cousins since 1984 ' and refers specifically to two brothers.It is conceded that the file note was not brought to the applicant's attention by the Tribunal.There is no indication that it was relied upon in the Tribunal's decision, and no clear indication that it was considered at the hearing.The transcript records, however, an exchange at the Tribunal hearing as follows: TRIBUNAL MEMBER: ... Now the other thing that was in your application [applicant's name] was that your brother was gaoled.THE WITNESS: Two of them.TRIBUNAL MEMBER: It said: They gaoled many of my brothers and cousins, they gaoled my brother [applicant's brother's name] for two years.When was that?THE WITNESS: In [year] , I am not sure about the date but when I was studying at the Uni, for about [period of time] and the other one is [applicant's brother's name] for about [period of time].TRIBUNAL MEMBER: You haven't mentioned that before?THE WITNESS: Sorry?THE INTERPRETER: Yes I mentioned that in my application.TRIBUNAL MEMBER: I see there we are, later [applicant's brother's name] , I couldn't read it I am sorry, it was the writing on the front sorry.Later [applicant's brother's name] they gaoled him for [period of time].This passage is not conclusive of whether the Tribunal specifically referred to the Department file note.However, it was suggested by the second respondent that the Tribunal member's original misconception relating to the number of brothers which the applicant claimed had been arrested may have been derived from the incorrect information contained in the file note.The applicant has submitted that the failure by the Tribunal to provide the file note to the applicant was a breach of procedural fairness by the Tribunal.He relies upon the decision of the High Court in Applicant VEAL of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 72 ; (2005) 80 ALJR 228.The decision in VEAL also concerned a decision made by the Refugee Review Tribunal.In that case, the Department had received an unsolicited letter which contained allegations relating to the appellant.The letter was passed on to the Tribunal by the Department, but the Tribunal did not tell the appellant about the letter or about the allegations contained in it.The Tribunal made a decision refusing a protection visa on the basis that the applicant lacked credibility, but explicitly indicated in its reasons that it had given no weight to the letter in arriving at its decision.The High Court held that the Tribunal had failed to afford the applicant procedural fairness.The Court held that information that was credible, relevant and significant must be provided to an affected person and that an opportunity must be given to the person to deal with the information before a decision was reached: see at [17].It stated that credible, relevant and significant information was information ' that cannot be dismissed from further consideration by the decision-maker before making the decision ' and noted that whether information is credible, relevant and significant does not depend ' upon whatever characterisation of the information the decision-maker may later have chosen to apply to the information when expressing reasons for the decision that has been reached ': see at [17].At [19] in VEAL , the Court said: As has later been rightly said, " the necessity to disclose such material in order to accord procedural fairness is not based on answering a causal question as to whether the material did in fact play a part in influencing the decision " .It follows that asking whether, despite what was said in its reasons, the Tribunal may have been subconsciously affected by the information distracts attention from the relevant inquiry.The relevant inquiry is: what procedures should have been followed?The relevant inquiry is neither what decision should the decision-maker have made, nor what reasons did the decision-maker give for the conclusion reached.The second respondent submits that VEAL is distinguishable from the present case on the basis of Bennett J's decision in SZECD v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 31 ; (2006) 150 FCR 53.In that decision, Bennett J distinguished the decision in VEAL on the basis that although procedural unfairness had been established in respect of one basis of the Tribunal's decision, there was a separate and independent basis for its conclusion which was not affected by procedural unfairness: see at [28], [40]-[41].I accept that, for the purposes of determining the applicant's credibility, the information contained in the file note was credible, relevant and significant.The information in the file note had the potential to affect findings on the applicant's credibility.That information should have been provided to the applicant, and he should have been given an opportunity to comment upon it.However, in my opinion, had that information been provided to the applicant, it could not have made any difference to the Tribunal's decision.In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful of the observations of the High Court in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141.In that case, the Court considered the circumstances in which it was appropriate not to order a new trial because it would inevitably result in the making of the same order as that made at the first trial.Whilst the Court observed that ' not every departure from the rules of natural justice at a trial will entitle the aggrieved party to a new trial ', it cautioned at 145: Where, however, the denial of natural justice affects the entitlement of a party to make submissions on an issue of fact ... it is more difficult for a court of appeal to conclude that compliance with the requirements of natural justice could have made no difference .... when the Full Court is invited by a respondent to exercise these powers in order to arrive at a conclusion that a new trial, sought to remedy a denial of natural justice relevant to a finding of fact, could make no difference to the result already reached, it should proceed with caution.The procedural unfairness alleged in the present case is directed to a finding of fact, namely a finding as to the applicant's credibility.However, I am nonetheless satisfied that this is a case in which the provision of the information could have made no difference to the result, because the applicant's credibility was determined in his favour.The Tribunal made no adverse findings on the applicant's credibility, but rather believed his factual account.The applicant submitted that the Tribunal impliedly made adverse credibility findings, because it did not find that he had a well-founded fear of persecution.However, the examples pointed to by the applicant were those in which the Tribunal did not agree with the applicant's assessment of events, not where it disbelieved his account of the facts.The Tribunal accepted that the applicant and his brothers and cousins had been detained by the Libyan government.It accepted his description of what had occurred at his place of work and the details of his education.What it did not agree with was the applicant's explanation for these events.While the applicant believed that they resulted from religious persecution, the Tribunal disagreed.The Tribunal did not believe the applicant was lying about the facts.It just considered that he was wrong in his interpretation of them.In terms of the applicant's credibility, the Tribunal clearly found in the applicant's favour.The material contained in the file note was credible, relevant and significant only in respect of the issue of the applicant's credibility.It could not have been relevant to any of the other findings made by the Tribunal.The Tribunal's decision did not include any adverse findings upon the applicant's credibility, but rather was based upon its assessment of his risk of persecution in Libya, derived from independent country information and from its assessment of his personal circumstances.Giving the applicant an opportunity to comment upon the file note could not possibly have altered the Tribunal's findings in respect of matters unrelated to his credibility.For these reasons, I consider that this ground must also be rejected.Regardless of whether a breach of procedural fairness has in fact occurred, I consider that to order the matter to be remitted to the Tribunal would be futile and if a breach of procedural fairness were in fact established, I would exercise my discretion not to order a re-hearing.Accordingly, this ground must fail.CONCLUSION In view of the above, the applicant's application must fail, and the applicant should pay the second respondent's costs.</doc>

refusedconferral between parties for agreement on terms of subpoenas and documents to be producedcorporationsFOR LEAVE TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS The respondents, through their common director, Mr Norman Carey, apply for leave to issue subpoenas to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) seeking production from ASIC of their financial and other records said to be in the possession of ASIC as a result of its ongoing investigation into matters relating to Westpoint Corporation.In these proceedings, ASIC seeks winding up orders against the 13 respondents which are part of the Westpoint Property and Finance Group.The originating application is based upon non-compliance with statutory demands for repayment of debts shown as owing according to the books and records of the Westpoint Corporation.I have already set out in the reasons I gave earlier dealing with the validity of the originating process, the nature of the statutory demands, the fact that there was evidence of their service, supported by verifying affidavits, and subsequently evidence that the demands were not met, and that no application was made to set them aside.I referred also, in my earlier reasons, to the requirements for an affidavit verifying continuing debt in support of both a statutory demand and an application for a winding up for non-compliance with a demand where something other than a judgment debt is being relied upon.That much having been established, that is to say that the originating process is valid, the respondents, through their director, Mr Carey, now seek leave to issue subpoenas to ASIC in respect of documents which it has seized or otherwise acquired in connection with its ongoing investigation into the Westpoint Property Group.The applications for leave to issue subpoenas to ASIC appear to rest on two bases set out in Mr Carey's affidavit of 15 August 2006.One of those bases raises a question about the nature of the debts relied upon to ground the statutory demands.He said that those accrued debts and credits were recorded pursuant to an arrangement for the Westpoint Group, under which Westpoint Corporation acted in effect as the Group treasurer.He said that: the member companies of the group engaged in transactions with one another, so they accrued debts credits [sic[ to one another from time to time.These were reconciled in the accounts of the group's central treasury, namely Westpoint Corporation, where they were recorded as non-current related party loans, as an accounting device to reflect the accruals made by the subsidiaries in the group in respect of each other.They did not reflect any formal loan arrangements whereby amounts were made payable by one entity to another in accordance with strict terms.The balances were simply adjusted as the accruals flowed between one entity and another.He also said that:a matter of practice, when a member company [that is to say, a member of the Westpoint Group] generated sufficient operating profits, or sold property at a profit, or profitably completed a commercial project, the proceeds would be employed to reduce the accrued debit of that subsidiary.Mr Carey referred to the financial reports of Westpoint Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2004, which were exhibited to his affidavit, and in particular to an entry entitled 'Non-current Loans from related parties - unsecured'.This, he believed, referred to the accruals between member companies of the Westpoint Group as described above.He also referred to the final statement in the relevant note to the accounts: from related parties incur no interest and have no fixed term for repayment.He expressed his belief that this is a reference to the fact that they were not intended to become payable on strict terms, as in reality they were not true loans.Mr Carey also referred to Mr Zohar's affidavit, which was the verifying affidavit in relation to the existence of the debts set out in the statutory demands and said he believed that each of the debts referred to in the table in Mr Zohar's affidavit was:a related party accrual, such as described above, which is not presently due and payable.The notes to and forming part of the financial statements of Westpoint Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2004 showed substantial sums of money under the heading 'Loans from related parties --- unsecured'.The consolidated figure for 2004 was $99,767,901.I have already referred to the note that was recorded below that entry.Mr Carey's explanation of the entries verged on the unintelligible in a legal sense, and did not appear to disclose any proper basis upon which the statutory demands could have been challenged.But assuming in favour of the respondents that it did, the fact is that the statutory demands were served on the registered offices of each of the respondents, which were at 160 St Georges Terrace.Each of the notices was served with a supporting affidavit and a covering letter to Mr Carey.Service is not in dispute, and indeed, Mr Nixon on behalf of the respondents expressly disclaimed any dispute about service.Mr Carey, in his affidavit, described a system which he had for the receipt of correspondence coming in.He said that in March 2006 the system he had in place to obtain hand delivered correspondence was as follows: document that was delivered by hand addressed to me was received by the receptionist, who recorded receipt of the document in a correspondence log, and brought it immediately to my office.If I was present in my office, the document would be handed to me.If I was not present in my office, the document would be left in a tray which I kept for incoming correspondence, which I inspected whenever I returned to my office.He said:the best of my recollection I attended my office every week day during March 2006.He also said that during that time he spoke to his brother, Allan Frank Carey, and his sister, Karen Sandra Carey-Hazell, daily:discuss, among other things, the affairs of the companies of which we held directorships, including whether we had received correspondence which related to them.He then said:did not ever receive any of the statutory demands referred to in Mr McLean's affidavit.Nor did I receive any notification that they had been served until I received the originating process herein, accompanied by Mr McLean's affidavit, in July 2006.was surprised not to have received any informal notification of service of the documents from KordaMentha as, during March 2006, their representatives regularly telephoned me, or came down to Level 7 from Level 9 to speak to me personally, in relation to Westpoint Corporation affairs, in particular, documents which required my signature.I known about any of the statutory demands respectively served on the respondents, I would have immediately obtained legal representation for each and issued instructions to apply to have the statutory demands set aside on the grounds that the debts to which they relate were not due and payable, as deposed to above.Mr Nixon submitted that, notwithstanding the service of demands, where they have not been received there is authority to support the proposition that if directors of a company who haven't seen a statutory demand within 21 days of its service would have acted reasonably and proceeded to set it aside or apply to set aside, had they received it, or have otherwise acted reasonably, then there is room for consideration of the question, going to the solvency of the company, as to whether the debts exist.In my opinion, however, whatever circumstances may mitigate the failure to apply to set aside a statutory demand regularly served on a company's office, those circumstances do not exist here.The position, seems to me, to be governed by s 459S of the Act.So far as the respondent's application for leave to issue subpoenas to ASIC is based upon an intention to raise a question as to whether the debts relied upon were due and payable, that is a matter which could have been raised in a challenge to the statutory demands.In my opinion, it is precluded by operation of s 459S and I would not grant leave to issue any subpoena for that purpose.The question of the solvency of the companies remains.The presumption of insolvency, arising from non-compliance with the statutory demand, is provided for in s 459C of the Act, which states inter alia that: Court must presume that the company is insolvent if, during or after the 3 months ending on the day when the application was made: the company failed (as defined by section 459F) to comply with a statutory demand; ... A presumption for which this section provides operates except so far as the contrary is proved for the purposes of the application.There is scope, other than by challenge to the debt set out in the statutory demand, for demonstrating the solvency of a company in opposition to a winding-up application.The range of the documents sought under the subpoenas, on the assumption that they are directed to that end, which is in part addressed in a rather general way in Mr Carey's affidavit is very large.It covers all financial books and records of the company in each case, 'including but not limited to', and then follows a list of 13 categories of documents with extensive definitions.I am not prepared to grant leave to the respondents to issue subpoenas to ASIC covering the range and volume of documents which they seek.The width of the proposed subpoenas suggests that the respondents are looking, in the material, for some basis for establishing their own solvency.I bear in mind that there is evidence that, for a number of the respondents, financial records remain in their own possession in computerised form.I do not know what the position is with the other respondents not covered by the affidavit material in relation to that.It seems to me that Mr Carey, being a director of all these respondents, in association with other officers of those companies, should be able to identify in a relatively focused way the basis upon which he would assert that they are solvent, notwithstanding the presumption, and the material that would be necessary to make-out that proposition, contrary to the presumption.ASIC has made an offer to identify relevant files with a view to providing to the respondents an opportunity to narrow the range of documents that they would seek under subpoena.In my opinion I should refuse leave to issue the subpoenas in their present form but make directions with a view to allowing ASIC and the respondents to see whether they can reach agreement on the terms of the subpoenas or the classes of documents which might be produced consensually for the purpose of these proceedings.The orders I propose to make are as follows: Leave to the respondents to issue the subpoenas, drafts of which were filed in Court, is refused.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is to provide the respondents with a list of files in its possession which are, in its opinion, relevant to the question of solvency of the respondents by 30 August 2006.The question of the class of documents which might properly be produced on the question of solvency is referred to a Registrar for mediation at one conference only to be held on or before 6 September 2006.Any application for leave to issue any further subpoena is to be brought on 13 September 2006 at 9am at which time further direction will be given for the conduct and trial of the application.Any application for leave under s 459S of the Corporations Act 2001  is to be made on 13 September 2006.The respondents are to pay the applicant's costs of the application to issue the subpoenas.</doc>

international market.One of its major competitors is the Incat Group of Companies (Incat) whose principal shipbuilding facilities are located in Tasmania.In May 2006 Mr Steven Thurlow, a Marketing Consultant employed by Incat Europe Ltd, sent an email to a Norwegian company called Master Ferries which attached a confidential, in-house report prepared by Austal.The report contained a mathematical modelling of the comparative seakeeping characteristics of its catamaran and trimaran ferries.The report was of a preliminary and confidential nature and indicated that the seakeeping characteristics of the 126 metre Austal trimaran were inferior to those of the 101 metre catamaran.Mr Thurlow used the Austal Report in his email as a basis for making disparaging remarks about the Austal trimaran.A former employee of Austal, Mr Justin Merrigan, had left Austal's employ on 28 January 2005 and from June 2005 commenced employment as a Public Relations and Marketing Officer for the Incat Group of Companies.As an employee of Austal he had had access to its confidential research and development reports, including the report attached to Mr Thurlow's email.Austal is concerned that

infringement of Austal's copyright in the report.Austal says that the report has since been superseded by more extensive investigations which show the trimaran to be superior to the catamaran.Austal seeks preliminary discovery orders against Messrs Merrigan and Thurlow and members of the Incat Group of Companies.It does this in order to determine whether it has a cause of action against any, and if so which, of them.For the reasons which follow, I am satisfied that there is reason to believe that some or all of the respondents have, or are likely to have, possession of documents which would tend to assist Austal in determining against whom it has a cause or causes of action, at least for breach of confidence and infringement of copyright.I am satisfied also that Austal, having written to the respondents seeking discovery of the documents, before commencing action, has, in the circumstances, made all reasonable enquiries, for the purposes of the Rules so as to justify the making of orders for preliminary discovery.The orders sought by Austal however range far wider than is appropriate and while I propose to accede to their application, the orders made will be considerably narrower in scope than those which have been sought.Factual and procedural background Austal was incorporated and commenced business in 1988.It is a leading designer and manufacturer of high performance aluminium vessels.It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Austal Ltd, which was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in 1998 and which has a current market capitalisation of about $450 million.Austal manufactures a range of light weight, high speed vessels including monohulls, catamarans and trimarans which range in size from 20 to 130 metres for commercial, military and naval applications.It employs 1,700 people at its shipbuilding facilities located on the waterfront at Henderson, immediately south of Fremantle in Western Australia and at Mobile in Alabama in the United States.Since it was formed Austal has designed and secured orders for manufacture and delivery of about 160 vessels including fast passenger and vehicle-passenger ferries.In June 2003 Austal entered into a contract for the design and construction of a 126 metre trimaran vehicle-passenger ferry for a European ferry operator, Fred Olsen SA.At that time the high speed vehicle-passenger ferry market had been dominated by catamarans.The use of trimarans was a relatively new concept in that market.In September 2003 Austal's Research and Development Department prepared an internal report dated 25 September 2003 entitled 'Analysis of the Ship Motion Performance of an Austal 101m Catamaran and a Comparison with a 126m Trimaran in the Irish Sea' (the Austal Report).The analysis was carried out by a process of mathematical modelling based on wave data for a ferry route from Dublin to Douglas in the Isle of Man and then to Liverpool and return.Wave height statistics for these routes were derived from data collected by service ships during the period from 1854 to 1997 and found in the Global Marine Climatic Atlas (GMCA).For the purpose of analysing the ship's motion performance a wave scatter diagram for the whole of the year was utilised as illustrated in tables set out in the report and said to represent a through-year surface.Wave direction statistics were also obtained from the GMCA.Three motion criteria were assumed as indicative of the comfort level of passengers travelling on these routes.They were: Motion sickness indices  --- a measure of the level of motion sickness resulting from vertical acceleration over a range of frequencies in accordance with an established methodology.The values were calculated for a position at the centre of the ship's main passenger cabin over a two hour period.Lateral force estimator , being a measure of the force in plane with the deck that is an indicator of the force creating a loss of balance of a standing person.This was said to be a function of the vessel's roll, sway and yaw and was calculated at the centre of the main passenger deck.Roll, which was the estimated rms value of ship roll.Limiting motion criteria chosen were: MSI 10% over 2 hrs LFE 0.05m  Roll angle 3&#176;  The two vessels whose characteristics were used for the comparative analysis were a proposed 101m Auto Express Austal Catamaran and a 126m Trimaran.The characteristics of each in terms of length, displacement and speed were set out in a table.Both vessels were assumed to be fitted with T-foils forward and transom interceptors or flaps.The trimaran was also assumed to be fitted with roll stabilisers on the main hull.The analysis was carried out for both ships on reciprocal headings (out and return journeys).Vertical acceleration and roll angle were calculated by standard means based upon vessel response information obtained from numerical analyses which had been carried out for the 126m trimaran and for the 101m Auto Express.The MSI values were calculated from vertical acceleration values over one-third octave bands.By plotting maximum wave height for a given wave period at which the individual criteria were met on the wave scatter diagram, it was said to be a simple matter to sum the percentage occurrence below the line which represented the percentage occurrence in which selected criteria would not be exceeded.By integrating the percentage of wave directions with directional maximum operating limits, the maximum 'operability' for both vessels travelling in both outward and inward directions was calculated.These values were given in Tables 5 to 8 of the paper.The result was expressed numerically by a value attached to 'the overall mean of the operability'.This figure, which was in terms of a percentage, was assessed for route 1 which was the Liverpool to Douglas return route and route 2, which was the Douglas to Dublin return route.The overall mean of the operability for the Austal 101 Auto Express Catamaran was 97.1% for route 1 and 89.8% for route 2.The overall mean of the operability for the 126m trimaran was 94.6% for route 1 and 87.5% for route 2.As put in Austal's submissions, the key finding of the Austal Report was that the catamaran was, in effect, superior in terms of seakeeping when compared with the trimaran in this mathematical modelling.According to the affidavit of Christopher Scott Gerrard, Austal's Commercial Manager, sworn on 16 June 2006, the Austal Report was prepared as part of an initial investigation by the Austal sales team of a suitable vessel design for a commercial ferry operator in the Irish Sea.He described it as 'a preliminary or opening basis for further work' which was 'entirely superseded by later research and development work on the subject'.He referred to a series of later investigations culminating in a report dated 10 June 2004 which concluded that the catamaran was significantly inferior to the trimaran on the routes and in the conditions stated by the Austal Report.He exhibited from the report of June 2004 an Executive Summary which compared an Austal 127m trimaran with a 101m catamaran.The Austal 127m trimaran was said to exhibit an improved MSI, LFE and roll motions for all wave headings on the Dublin/Douglas/Liverpool routes.The Austal Report and subsequent reports were stored in a computer archive by the Research and Development Department.The Austal report was not used by the sales team for any proposal nor, according to Mr Gerrard, was it sent outside Austal to any potential customer or to any other person.A major competitor of Australia is the Incat Group of Companies which includes each of the first to seventh and ninth respondents named in the proceedings WAD 165 of 2006.It designs, constructs and sells large catamarans for use as ferries for people and goods.It has its principal ship building facilities in Tasmania.It mainly builds vehicle-passenger ferries.These range in price from $15 million to $100 million.Justin Merrigan, who is named as the respondent in WAD 163 of 2006, was employed by Austal as a Public Relations and Marketing Officer in April 2004.He was bound under his contract to keep confidential all knowledge and information concerning the interests of Austal acquired in the course of his employment.He had access to Austal's database and material relating to its research and development activities.This included work in connection with the Irish Sea.According to Mr Gerrard, the Irish Sea was a market of particular interest to Mr Merrigan as he had worked with ferry operators there previously.Mr Merrigan also had access to the Austal report and those which superseded it.Mr Merrigan resigned from Austal on 14 January 2005 and left its employ on 28 January 2005.He relocated to Tasmania where, at some time prior to June 2005, he was employed as a Public Relations and Marketing Officer with the Incat Group of Companies.Mr Steven Thurlow, who is named as the respondent in WAD 162 of 2006, is a marketing consultant employed by Incat Europe Ltd, which is incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey in the Channel Islands.It is not a subsidiary of any of the respondent members of the Incat Group and does not carry on business or have a registered office in Australia.I accept nevertheless that it is part of the Incat Group.Mr Thurlow's business card was exhibited to the affidavit of Matthew Holgate, a legal practitioner acting for the Austal Group.It bears the letterhead 'www.INCAT.com.au'.It describes him as a 'Marketing Consultant, Europe'.It gives addresses and telephone numbers in Tasmania, Denmark and the United Kingdom.Neither Mr Merrigan nor Mr Thurlow filed affidavits in reply to the evidence put on by Austal.On about 26 May 2006 one of Austal's European service agents received a copy of an email which had apparently been sent by Mr Thurlow on or about 3 May 2006.The addressee of the email was whited out.The email bore the endorsement 'Confidential --- As requested' and the heading 'Seakeeping report Austal 101 versus 126 tri on Irish Sea pdf'.The text of the email was as follows: is the report, please keep this confidential.have seen that it has taken years for the truth to emerge on various other HSC which at the time receiving glowing publicity.I believe this will be the case with the trimaran and having read the attached report I am absolutely convinced that this trimaran is a con.It is well known in the market that the Austal 101 is far inferior to the Incat 98 metre in terms of seakeeping, yet in this Austal report the Austal 101 comes out significantly better than the trimaran which is around 26 metres longer on the waterline and offers a 4 metre wider beam.It uses a huge amount of fuel to move each dead weight tonne over an Incat 98 metre; The reported contract price of EUR60 million (versus an Austal 101 which is around EUR44 million); It was delivered 6 months late in delivery due to technical problems, having to add rudders to be able to steer the ship; The trimaran has twice the number of submerged control surfaces that the Austal 101 metre catamaran has; In the first year of service the trimaran has missed several weeks of sailings due to technical problems is a huge gap between what the PR department are saying and what technocrats know is the truth.think a move [words whited out] into the 98 metre is a timely, sound and the logical step forward in order to be able to carry freight and to get good all round weather reliability.In terms of capital, Incat 060 costs a little over half the capital cost of a trimaran, it is proven in service, and it is available quickly.It will be considerably easier to berth in port as it is 28 metres shorter overall.that I believe at 105 metres on the waterline, the Incat 112 metre will be a far superior ship than the trimaran in terms of capital cost, operating economies, speed, and deadweight capacity.let me know if you want more information.Regards, Steve' It may be noted that none of the contentions set against the bullet points in Mr Thurlow's email reflected the contents of the Austal Report, which have already been summarised.Austal and, in particular, its Commercial Manager, Mr Gerrard, thought that the email had been sent to Irish Ferries, a prominent commercial ferry operator in the Irish Sea.As has subsequently emerged however, particularly from the affidavit of Mr Simon Carter, the Legal Manager for the Incat Group, the email was in fact sent to Mr Tom Bringsvaerd and Mr Bernt Mykjaland, who are principals of a Norwegian registered and domiciled company known as Master Ferries Holding AS (Master Ferries).It appears that Master Ferries had been in commercial negotiations with the Incat Group which led to them purchasing a second hand ship from the Incat Group on 27 February 2006.According to Mr Carter's instructions from Mr Thurlow, Master Ferries had not previously owned or operated high speed vessels.It is clear from the text of Mr Thurlow's email that it attached a copy of the Austal Report.On 12 June 2006 Stables Scott, solicitors acting for Austal, sent letters to the Incat Group respondents and to Messrs Merrigan and Thurlow.In the letter to the Incat Group they asserted Austal's belief that it had or might have a right to obtain relief against Incat for: infringement of copyright in the Austal Reportbreach of duty of confidence in equity in relation to the contents of the Austal Reportcontraventions of s 52 and other provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 damages for injurious falsehooddamages for interference with contractual relations; and injunctive relief.The letter was predicated upon the belief that Mr Thurlow's email had been sent to Irish Ferries.The letter repudiated some of the allegations contained in Mr Thurlow's email and asserted Austal's concern that Incat and Mr Thurlow had come into possession of the Austal Report with the assistance, direct or indirect, of Mr Justin Merrigan.The letter to the Incat Group set out the bases upon which Austal raised the possibility of the various causes of action mentioned and then stated: the contents of the Thurlow Email, and the fact of the attached Austal Report are relevant to Austal's belief that it has or may have a right to obtain relief against Incat, it presently does not have sufficient information to make a decision as to whether to commence legal proceedings against Incat, based upon information and documents as presently available to it, in the public domain.in order to assist Austal in making a decision as to whether to commence legal proceedings against Incat, we are instructed to request Incat make available to us for inspection, all documents which are or Incat has had in its possession, custody or power, as described in the categories of documents sought to be inspected, as referred to below, which categories of documents: are not otherwise available in the public domain to Austal; are relevant to the issue as to whether Austal has the right to obtain the various relief, as referred to above; will assist Austal determine what, if any, defences may be available to Incat, and the strength of any such defence; will also assist Austal determine the extent of Incat's alleged unlawful conduct, in relation to each of the legal breaches as referred to above and the likely quantum of any damages award; and otherwise having regard to these matters, will be of assistance to Austal in relation to making a decision as to whether commencement of legal proceedings against Incat is justified.The letter from Stables Scott to Incat sought a wide range of documents not limited to documents relating to the email or the Austal Report.It extended to documents evidencing communications by or from Incat during a period called 'the Relevant Period' and involving a reference, directly or indirectly, to: the Thurlow Email; the Austal Report; the Austal 126 trimaran; and any comparison between the Austal 126 trimaran with an Austal 101 catamaran and/or Incat Catamaran.Inspection of such documents was sought by Friday 23 June 2006.Similar letters were sent to Messrs. Thurlow and Merrigan.On 16 June 2006, after Mr Gerrard had sworn his first affidavit, Mr Carter, in his capacity as 'Legal Manager Incat Group of Companies', advised Stables Scott by email that he had received initial instructions on behalf of each of the respondents in these proceedings.In the meantime, on the same day, Austal's discovery request not having been met, Mr Gerrard instructed Stable Scott to file the present applications seeking preliminary discovery.Mr Carter's email to Mr Holgate at Stables Scott said, inter alia: has not been sufficient time since the receipt of your correspondence to enable me to obtain instructions in sufficient detail in relation to the numerous and detailed matters which you have raised.The instructions which must necessarily be obtained include those from persons who are travelling overseas.am hopeful that appropriate and sufficient instructions will be obtained within the next 14 days, and I that I will then be in a position to respond.On 20 June 2006 Mr Carter sent an email to Mr Holgate advising that he had instructions to accept service of process on behalf of the respondents in each of the applications.On 21 June 2006 Mr Craig Clifford, who is a Director or the Managing Director of a number of the Incat Group of Companies, sent an email to John Rothwell the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Austal.The email was marked 'Without Prejudice' but privilege is waived by the respondents.In the email, which was evidently not received by Mr Rothwell, Mr Clifford expressed surprise at the commencement of Federal Court proceedings.He said that over the years Incat and Austal had enjoyed a healthy rivalry and competition accompanied by what he would classify as relatively normal 'tit for tat' exchanges and banter in the market place about the merits or otherwise of the products they each offered.He said that generally the rivalry was addressed in good spirit between themselves and he believed the market place respected the two leading Australian companies.After further preliminaries he went on to say: receipt of your complaint, I had our Legal Services Manager contact your office to find out more to its background, and if the complaint was found to be of substance, what remedy Austal was seeking to achieve in pursuing same.Neither was revealed to us, and indeed the only response to this approach was the formal filing of documents with the Court.We will of course formally respond to the Court in the normal manner.I do know however, from bitter experience in a very protracted and very public litigation pursued by our mutual friends at Sea Containers, that there are few certainties once litigation gets fully underway, and potentially out of hand.Litigation generally takes on a life of its own and tends to bite indiscriminately.This, to my mind at least, just serves to underline how unedifying and potentially profitless to both sides these proceedings could become.I'm still unsure of what is trying to be achieved here.If one of our marketing guys has been out of line, then I'm quite happy to investigate same, address the individual and make sure that it doesn't happen again.At the moment, my advice is that the email you have taken issue with was sent on a confidential, one on one, basis to a Norwegian gentleman representing a customer in Norway and in an attempt to compare and explain differences in the type of product we each offer to the marketplace.I am instructed that the said Norwegian has vehemently confirmed that the email went no further, which obviously can not be correct, as it has found its way into your hands.I am making further enquiry about this discrepancy.If you are prepared to reveal the means by which the email found its way to you, then that will speed up my investigation.am instructed that the said Norwegian has no interest in the Irish Sea region you refer to in your complaint.I am instructed that the email has only ever been provided to this Norwegian, no other person or group and certainly not to any other customer, in the Irish Sea or otherwise.I am disappointed that the status quo in our competitive relationship has been disturbed, and hope that this particular scrap is a one off and can be quickly resolved.I would be disappointed from both our perspectives if the gloves now needed to come off completely, as I can see this doing no one any good, particularly the industry, which we have each fought so hard to establish.await your response.It does not appear that Mr Rothwell received the email although there was no evidence from him on that point.It was suggested by Mr Gerrard that it may have been caught up in a spam email filter.This was just a theory.I accept that, for whatever reason, the email was not seen by Mr Rothwell.It seems likely that some sort of response would have followed had it been seen and that the response would have been put in evidence.Even if it had been seen it would not, in my opinion, affect the outcome of these applications.On 3 July 2006 Mr Carter spoke by telephone with Mr Holgate and they discussed the letter of demand.Their conversation was without prejudice and they were unable to reach any agreement to resolve the matter.The respondents did not waive the privilege attaching to that without prejudice communication.In an affidavit in support of the applications, Mr Holgate of Stables Scott, the solicitors acting for Austal, asserted his belief that from the evidence presently available to Austal it had reasonable cause to believe that it has, or may have, a right to claim relief against Messrs Thurlow and Merrigan and the various companies comprising the Incat Group in respect of the various matters raised in the letters of request mentioned earlier.He made particular reference to an action for infringement of copyright in the Austal Report and the fact that such cause of action would extend to any party who authorised the infringing act as well as third parties who might innocently be in possession of the Austal Report and engage in infringing conduct.He also asserted his belief that Austal's rights to obtain relief might well go beyond Mr Thurlow and involve his relationship with other persons or entities who may have authorised or been responsible for his actions or who might possess infringing copies of the Austal Report.Mr Holgate expressed his concern that evidence currently in the possession of Austal, as set out in the Gerrard affidavits, was insufficient for a proper determination to be made as to who might be the appropriate respondents in any substantive proceedings which might be contemplated by Austal in relation to a potential claim for infringements of its copyright, as well as contravention of s 52 of the Act.Mr Holgate said that he could not get from the public domain sufficient evidence to identify the party or parties who might have been responsible for the alleged infringement and who might possess infringing copies.He asserted that these circumstances justified an application for discovery being made under O 15A r 3, as well as under O 15A r 6.He said that he was unable to ascertain a direct or indirect involvement, if any, of the first to ninth respondents in the distribution of the Austal Report attached to Mr Thurlow's email.In relation to Mr Thurlow, he could not determine from the material currently in possession of Austal from whom, if anyone, Mr Thurlow received instructions to distribute the report.He was unable to determine whether Mr Thurlow was employed or otherwise engaged by any, and if so which of, the first to ninth respondents.In this respect he referred to Mr Thurlow's business card which was provided to him by Mr Gerrard.The evidence and information in the possession of Austal did not allow him to determine how Mr Thurlow came to be in possession of the Austal Report and the circumstances surrounding his apparent distribution of that report to Irish Ferries.This latter reference of course was based on the inference, apparently drawn by Mr Gerrard, that the email had been sent to Irish Ferries and not, as subsequently emerged, to Master Ferries.Similar limitations arose in connection with the information available about the involvement (if any) of Mr Merrigan and the basis of his employment or engagement with any of the respondents.Statutory framework --- the Rules of Court Order 15A of the Federal Court Rules provides in the relevant parts: Where an applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a person sufficiently for the purpose of commencing a proceeding in the Court against that person (in this rule called "the person concerned") and it appears that some person has or is likely to have knowledge of facts, or has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document or thing, tending to assist in such ascertainment, the Court may make an order under subrule .The Court may order that the person, and in the case of a corporation, the corporation by an appropriate officer, shall --- attend before the Court to be examined in relation to the description of the person concerned; make discovery to the applicant of all documents which are or have been in the person's or its possession relating to the description of the person concerned.Where the Court makes an order under paragraph , it may --- order that the person or corporation against whom or which the order is made shall produce to the Court on the examination any document or thing in the person's or its possession relating to the description of the person concerned; direct that the examination be held before a Registrar.Rule 6 provides: there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision --- Court may order that that person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph .Whether preliminary discovery should be ordered The discovery orders sought rely upon both O 15A r 3 and O 15A r 6.The first rule applies, inter alia, where an applicant, having made reasonable inquiries, is unable to ascertain the description of a prospective respondent sufficiently for the purpose of commencing proceedings and some person has or is likely to have documents or things tending to assist in such ascertainment.The second rule applies where a prospective respondent has, or is likely to have, possession of documents relating to the question whether the applicant has a right to obtain relief.Both rules are relied upon to support the orders for preliminary discovery in each of the proceedings now brought.Rule 3 is also relied upon to support an order for examination of the respondents before the Court, but the applicant accepts that whether such an order should be made can await the outcome of the discovery and inspection of documents if such is ordered.I recently discussed the principles applicable to preliminary discovery under O 15 r 6 in East Grace Corporation v Xing (No 2) [2005] FCA 1266.It is not necessary to repeat here that discussion and the citation of authorities there set out.For the purposes of O 15A r 6 and O 15A r 3, I am satisfied that: There is reasonable cause to believe that Austal has, or may have, the right to obtain relief in this Court from Messrs Merrigan and Thurlow for one or more of the following causes of action: breach of confidence and infringement of copyright in the case of Mr Merrigan; infringement of copyright in the case of Mr Thurlow and possible accessorial liability in relation to breach of confidence.The applicant has made what, in the circumstances, are all reasonable enquiries.The term 'reasonable' in this context falls to be considered having regard to the degree of urgency necessary to act upon what is, on the face of it, a potentially serious breach of an obligation of confidentiality and unauthorised reproduction of a sensitive internal report of Austal.Wider enquiries are unlikely to elicit information relevant to the decision that Austal has to make as the necessary documentation is likely to be held by the respective respondents.No offer of disclosure has been made in response to the requests which have been sent.The offer of further investigation by Mr Clifford in the email sent to Mr Rothwell did not promise the kind of disclosure necessary for Austal to make the decision which it wants to make in relation to the institution of proceedings.There is reasonable cause to believe that Mr Merrigan and Mr Thurlow are likely to have in their possession documents, including email communications and copies of the Austal Report, relevant to the question whether Austal has a right to obtain relief against them.In the case of the Incat respondents, there are a number of companies some of which may have had no involvement at all in Mr Thurlow's apparent conduct in sending a copy of the Austal Report to Master Ferries.An order for discovery against the Incat respondents is likely to assist Austal in ascertaining against which, if any of them, it may have a cause of action.As to those of the respondents which are not involved, such respondents would have knowledge of facts as to their non-involvement which will assist the process of ascertainment of the relevant respondents which is contemplated by O 15A r 3.Discovery against Incat will also serve to assist Austal in ascertaining whether Mr Merrigan or some other person had breached confidentiality or infringed its copyright.Mr Thurlow is said to be a marketing consultant employed by Incat Europe Ltd.Whether or not he has any, and if so what, connection with other members of the Incat Group was not apparent, although it is apparent that Incat Europe is a member of the Group.The orders sought by Austal are, in my opinion, much wider than would be justified by the Rules.The Court is not here concerned with any cause of action based on disparaging statements about Austal's product made in Mr Thurlow's email.It is concerned primarily with the circumstances surrounding his acquisition of the Austal Report and the reproduction and publication of it to third parties.The orders proposed reflect this concern.The question of whether, and to what extent, any cause of action upon which Austal could rely arises in whole or in part within Australia may emerge with greater clarity when discovery is provided.The precise geographical location of elements of the acts which may give rise to a cause of action is not apparent from the materials before the Court although it is clear that Mr Thurlow has a Tasmanian point of contact, evidenced by his business card, that Mr Merrigan works or worked for Incat in Tasmania at relevant times and that Incat itself is an Australian-based corporate group.I will make orders reflecting these reasons but will allow liberty to the parties to apply to vary them for practical and timing reasons.</doc>

Ors v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FMCA 1980) whereby his Honour dismissed the appellants' application for review of the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') made on 28 April 2003 and delivered on 21 May 2003.That application was belated in that it was not filed in the Federal Magistrates Court until 14 July 2004.The reason for that lengthy delay of more than one year was not seemingly explained by the appellants, or in any event satisfactorily.Prior to that Tribunal decision, the Minister's delegate had refused what were successive applications for protection visas made by the appellants, the preceding Ministerial refusal having occurred as long ago as 30 August 2001.The appellants comprise respectively a husband and wife and their daughter, who claim to be citizens of Bangladesh and who arrived in Australia on 23 June 1997.Initial applications for protection visas had been made by the appellants on 18 July 1997 and refused by the Minister on 23 July 1997, and had been thereafter unsuccessfully pursued by way of appeal to the Federal Court, following upon the refusal of Tribunal intervention on 18 May 1999 by way of administrative review.Accordingly the appellants' subsequent application for protection visas the subject of this present appeal have involved what may be described as a repeated resort to the Tribunal administrative review process and to the Federal Court appellate process, though on these respective successive occasions, there also occurred an intervening application for review by way of appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court.However the second series of applications was acknowledged to have standing, upon the basis that the first series of applications had been invalidly made.That was said to be because in the context of the appellants' application for protection visas made on 3 July 2001, their migration adviser Mr Boni Amin claimed that '... my client in his initial application... did not put [in] a convention-based claim, which in fact was an invalid application, though it was reviewed by the RRT out of their legal jurisdiction'.In the foregoing context, and the review and appeal processes thus secondly pursued by the appellants, there occurred additionally the Federal Magistrates Court's review of that subsequent Tribunal decision of 16 December 2005.As I have indicated, the period of time between the two Tribunal administrative review proceedings was about four years.An elaboration upon the nature and implications of the current series of administrative review and appeals undertaken by the appellants is recorded below.The second Tribunal review undertaken by Nicholls FM comprised 35 paragraphs of reasons, and contained a comprehensive review of authority, involving reference to 32 decisions.The notice of appeal against the Federal Magistrate's decision was filed by the appellants on 6 January 2006.Shortly prior to the commencement on 29 May 2006 of the hearing of the present appellate proceedings, the appellants filed with the Court an amended notice of appeal, the principal grounds whereof were framed as follows: Breach of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 : There was certain adverse information that was a part of the tribunal's reasons for affirming the decision under review.The tribunal did not disclose the particulars of the information to the appellants.The information in the tribunal's first reasons for its decision was the first appellant's: employment history information"; residence history information"; date of attack information"; issue of arrest warrant information"; The information in the tribunal's second basis for its decision was the first appellant's: date of departure information"; date of lodgement of claim information"; same statutory declaration information"; failure to respond to DIMIA disclosure information"; The information in the tribunal's third basis for its decision was the first appellant's: criminal history information"; The information was specifically about the first appellant; The information was not given to the tribunal for the purpose of the application for review before the tribunal.Section 424A of the Migration Act 1958  ('the Migration Act '), so far as material to the present appeal, reads as follows: Subject to subsection , the Tribunal must: give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review; and invite the applicant to comment on it.This section does not apply to information: that is not specifically about the applicant or another person and is just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member; or that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application, or that is non-disclosable information.The appellants were represented at the hearing of the present appeal to the Federal Court by counsel not previously retained, and who appears to have been the author of the written submissions and an amended notice of appeal presented by the appellants to the Court a very short time prior to the commencement of the hearing subsequently to the presentation to the Court of the Minister's written submissions.The Minister adopted the expedient course of addressing the issues as raised by that fresh material, rather than seek any adjournment to consider the same.The full text of the orders framed by the appellants' amended notice of appeal and presently falling for consideration are also reproduced below: Leave be granted to file an amended notice of appeal.The Refugee Review Tribunal ("the tribunal") be joined as a party to the appeal.The first respondent be named the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs.The appeal be allowed.The orders made by the Federal Magistrate [on] 16 December 2005 be set aside and in their place it be ordered that: The proceeding be remitted to the Federal Magistrates Court for further hearing and determination.Alternatively, The tribunal be joined as a party to the application.There be an order in the nature of certiorari issued to quash the decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal N01/40035 made 28 April 2003 (and handed down 21 May 2003) be set aside.There be an order in the nature of mandamus issued ordering the tribunal to review the decision of the delegate of the Minister to refuse the protection visa sought by the applicant.The first respondent pay the costs of the applicant before the Federal Magistrates Court.The respondent to pay the appellants' costs of the appeal.As I have foreshadowed, counsel for the Minister indicated that no opposition was raised to the filing of the amended notice of appeal, nor to the presentation by the appellants of the case articulated by their counsel in belated written submissions, nor to the joinder of the Refugee Review Tribunal as an additional respondent.That joinder occurred consistently with the view of the High Court expressed in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 to the effect that the Tribunal is an officer of the Commonwealth for the purpose of s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 .Before proceeding further, it is appropriate that I outline the reasons of the Federal Magistrate upon his review of the Tribunal decision below (that is of course the second or later Tribunal decision of 16 December 2005).Outline of the reasons of the Federal Magistrates Court the subject of present appeal and my observations in relation to those reasons Nicholls FM summarised the appellants' complaints, as outlined to the Federal Magistrates Court by way of the amended application for review by way of appeal filed on 24 November 2004, as follows: denial of procedural fairness and natural justice, by reason of the Tribunal's bias or by reason that there was an apprehension of bias;withholding by the Tribunal from the appellants of independent country information about Bangladesh, and of the opportunity to comment thereon; andfailure by the Tribunal to take a 'fresh look' into the appellants' protection visa claim, and a 'totally ignor[ing]' by the Tribunal of that claim, which was asserted on behalf of the appellants to be '100% true' and as involving what was alleged by the appellants to be a 'political crisis within the BNP', and an absence of protection available to the appellants by what was described as the adult male appellant's 'own party'.In the result, his Honour found no substance or viability in relation to those complaints.However as will be seen from my ongoing summary of the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court below, it is necessary for me to set out in more detail his Honour's reasoned findings, given the width of scope of the issues addressed by his Honour.Nicholls FM ultimately addressed what became the critical discretionary issue as to delay by the appellants in their pursuit of their second Tribunal application, before proceeding to address the three issues broadly formulated as above by his Honour, and which I have outlined in the preceding paragraph.That issue of delay became ultimately the basis for dismissal of the appeal, which occurred at the culmination of his Honour's consideration of the various other issues raised in the Federal Magistrates Court below.The issue of delay was described by his Honour as 'unexplained and inconsistent with the action of someone who claims to fear persecution and who claims to be aggrieved by a Tribunal decision which did not recognise these claims' .His Honour referred to authority involving recognition of the element of discretion attending the exercise of the grant or refusal of prerogative relief in a migration law context, in particular in circumstances of unwarrantable delay.An exemplification of High Court authority on the subject of circumstances of unwarrantable delay identified by his Honour was Re Refugee Review Tribunal; Ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [53] and [82] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ).Reference was also made to what was observed subsequently by McHugh J in SAAP at [80] on the matter of delay.In the light of judicial authority cited by Nicholls FM and in the events which had happened, Nicholls FM concluded that the appellants were disqualified from entitlement to prerogative relief, by reason of the discretionary factor of unwarrantable delay in prosecution of the present proceedings.Nicholls FM emphasised in that regard not only the delay of some 13 months on the appellants' part in the lodgement of the later (or second successive) appeal from the Tribunal (this time to the Federal Magistrates Court), the filing whereof occurred on 14 July 2004, but pointed additionally to the withholding by the appellants of explanation for that delay, following upon the appellants having been invited by his Honour to make submissions on that issue.Incidentally the husband/father appellant ('the first appellant') addressed the Federal Magistrates Court on that occasion in person on behalf of his wife and his daughter, as well as of course of himself.His Honour's reasons for conclusion on that delay issue so raised by the Minister, being delay in relation of course to the commencement of this second (and current) series of administrative/curial proceedings mounted by the appellants, were as follows: delay is unexplained, and is inconsistent with the action of someone who claims to fear persecution and who claims to be aggrieved by a Tribunal decision which did not recognise these claims.Further, nor could the applicants argue any unfamiliarity with how to go about making an application to the Court in relation to a Tribunal decision.Clearly the applicants have already been through this process once before in relation to the complaint concerning the first Tribunal's decision, which was ultimately dismissed by the Federal Court....' Nicholls FM considered that his finding on delay alone sufficed as a viable basis for dismissal in its entirety of the application for review by way of that appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court from the Tribunal's second decision.Thereafter his Honour proceeded to discuss at length the remaining grounds of review propounded by the appellants, to which additional grounds I will now turn.A second ground for review raised below by the appellants in their notice of appeal was that of actual bias or apprehension of bias 'in the making of the purported decision'.The notice of appeal raised a purported natural justice issue based on actual bias or apprehension of bias.Nicholls FM cited a number authorities of the Federal Court and the High Court upon that subject, and concluded on that issue adversely to the appellants, as follows: can see no basis for review of the Tribunal's decision on the basis of actual or apprehended bias.The [appellants] have brought no evidence whatsoever to ground a complaint that the Tribunal did not bring an open mind to the assessment of the claims.It is rarely the case that bias can be made out with reference to the decision record alone, and no further evidence has been provided by the applicant in this respect...In that context his Honour made reference to VFAB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 872 ; (2003) 131 FCR 102 as an exemplification of those principles, where Kenny J found that a case of apprehended bias had been established adversely to a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, but which authority was said to exemplify the difficulty of establishing bias.I am unable to discern any viable footing for the appellants' case on bias, or reasonable apprehension of bias, to the extent that the same was ultimately pursued (if at all) on the present appeal, which was not entirely clear.As his Honour emphasised in any event, the doctrine of actual bias in the form of prejudgment seemingly invoked by the appellants required evidence of any such prejudgment by the decision-maker, to the extent that he or she is alleged to have been ' so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or argument may be presented', his Honour citing thereby Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng [2001] HCA 17 ; (2001) 205 CLR 507 at [72] (Gleeson CJ and Gummow J).No such evidence was adduced by the appellants.A third ground for review raised by the appellants below was that of denial of procedural fairness.Nicholls FM pointed to the matters and circumstances in favour of the Minister's case in response, and made the observations which I have correspondingly recorded below: the Tribunal wrote to the male appellant (being of course the husband/father) on 11 September 2001 and set out the process whereby it proposed to deal with what had become a second or further application for refugee status, thereby indicating ( inter alia ) that the Tribunal '... will look at your papers and decide whether it has jurisdiction to consider your application [and] if so, it will then look at your papers along with any other evidence on the Tribunal file to determine whether it can make a decision in your favour', and further that '[i]f the Tribunal cannot make a decision in your favour, you will be asked whether you want to come to a hearing of the Tribunal to give oral evidence and to present arguments...';there was however no evidence '... to show that the Tribunal's invitation to a hearing to put forward further evidence or arguments was anything other than a genuine attempt to focus the applicant's mind on the unsatisfactory nature of the material he had put forward to that time and to provide any opportunity for that to be addressed' ; there was no basis demonstrated therefore to the effect that such invitation of the Tribunal was merely 'a hollow shell or an empty gesture' .By referring to the 'applicant', Nicholls FM inferentially included the wife and child of the applicant husband/father (as elsewhere unless inconsistent with the context), all three being the then applicants (and of course the present appellants).I observe that the full names of all three appellants were recorded in the heading to that Tribunal letter of invitation of 11 September 2001 addressed to the first appellant.For the reasons which I have thus far outlined, Nicholls FM observed that he had been unable to distil any indication of a denial of procedural fairness on the part of the Tribunal below, notwithstanding the case foreshadowed to the Federal Magistrates Court to that effect.His Honour additionally observed on that subject that the Tribunal, in its later letter of 13 March 2003, had put the first appellant on notice that if he did not attend the Tribunal hearing, the consequences might be that the Tribunal would 'make a decision on your case without further notice' (see in that regard what appears in the first paragraph of the Tribunal's reasons for decision of 28 April 2003 under the heading 'Finding and Reasons' ).So much was described by his Honour as an indication by the Tribunal that any rejection of the invitation would lead to the kind of ' inevitable consequence ' spoken of by the Full Federal Court in NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 at [5] (French, Emmett and Dowsett JJ).However as Nicholls FM recorded, there was no attendance by or on behalf of any one or more of the present appellants, being a non-attendance which was unexplained, with the consequence of the Tribunal being '... authorised to proceed to decide the review in the applicant's absence' , his Honour citing ( inter alia ) VNAA v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 134 ; (2004) 136 FCR 407 at [16] (Sundberg and Hely JJ), and referring to s 426A of the Migration Act .A further element of the case for denial of natural justice advanced by the appellants against the Minister in the Federal Magistrates Court below related to the use made beforehand by the Tribunal of the country information upon which it purportedly relied relevantly to its decision-making.The complaints made in that regard, as Nicholls FM recorded in the course of his reasons for decision, were that the Tribunal did not give to the appellants the country information on which it relied, and further that the Tribunal did not extend to the appellants an opportunity to evaluate or make submissions otherwise concerning the use of that information.By reason of those omissions of the Tribunal complained of, the appellants asserted denial of natural justice.His Honour observed that the appellants' application for review of the Tribunal decision predated the enactment of s 422B of the Migration Act headed 'Exhaustive statement of natural justice hearing rule' , with the consequence that '[t]he common law rules of procedural fairness are not excluded from applying in the case before me' .Nevertheless as his Honour proceeded to record, '... there is no general proposition that the failure to put adverse country information to an applicant, on its own, amounts to a breach of natural justice' , citing thereby the Full Federal Court's decision in VHAP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 80 ALD 559 at [17] (Gyles and Conti JJ) and [27]-[28] (Allsop J).Nicholls FM acknowledged that country information issues raised at the instance of the Minister which gave rise to a breach of common law procedural fairness may in particular occur '... where the information is critical to the Tribunal decision, and the applicant is not on notice of the issues raised by the information' , and in those situations, the applicant for relief 'clearly should not be caught unawares or be in the dark about the case against him' .It was pointed out by his Honour however that '[i] n the case before me and in relation to the use of country information in the context of fairness the applicant was given the opportunity to attend a hearing before the Tribunal', and accordingly '[i] n circumstances where the Tribunal had put the applicant on notice that on what was before it, it could not make a decision in his favour... [then] [i] n the context of the common law principles of procedural fairness the applicant cannot now complain when he chose not to take up that opportunity' .Nicholls FM referred in that context to the following passage in the reasons for judgment in NAVX at [5]: assessing the adequacy of these reasons, it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information.Clearly enough, the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing persecution in China.Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, it could do little more than offer him an opportunity to elaborate.When he failed to accept that opportunity, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application.I should add for completeness, in relation to what the Tribunal had determined in the light of the country information available to it, that Nicholls FM further pointed out that '... the Tribunal is not required to invite comment on its thought processes on the way to its decision-making' , the Minister citing in support of that tenet what was said in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 (2003) 201 ALR 437 by Gummow and Heydon JJ at [54] and [57]-[58], and by Kirby J at [85]-[86], and further in Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 592 by Northrop, Miles and French JJ.It was pointed out further in the joint judgment of Gummow and Heydon JJ in S154/2002 at [56]-[58] that the evidentiary rule in Browne v Dunn 'has no application to proceedings in the tribunal', except to the extent that the rule might be exemplified in the requirements of s 424A.In the present case however, so Nicholls FM further pointed out, the Tribunal had foreshadowed explicitly to the appellants the conclusions which were open to be reached on the material in evidence placed before it, and which would be possibly adverse to them, and accordingly that '... the applicant could not have been left in the dark as to the risk of an adverse finding being made' .Furthermore as I have already recorded on related matters, by letter dated 11 September 2001 the Tribunal notified the appellants that once it might decide that it had jurisdiction to consider their application, '... it will then look at your papers along with any other evidence on the Tribunal file to determine whether it can make a decision in your favour'.So much was said 'clearly... [to] have included relevant documents from the [Minister's] department' which Nicholls FM thereupon particularised in his reasons.Additionally his Honour drew attention to the Tribunal's reference to other independent country information related to Bangladesh relied upon by the Minister on the application to the Tribunal for review, in relation to which the appellants 'would have been on notice of some of the country information used by the Tribunal from the delegate's reliance on it and... the rest... was... "general information" dealing with such matters as population distribution' .In his Honour's view therefore, '[i]n all the circumstances I cannot see that this complaint can be made out' , in that reference to the country information relied upon by the Tribunal was in reality adequately disclosed.Moreover his Honour further pointed out that '[i] n terms of the statutory requirements, the general country information relied on by the Tribunal, and in particular as referred to in its decision record... is clearly information that is excluded by s 424A of the Act from the obligation to put such information to the [appellants] pursuant to s 424A ' , being information described by s 424A as 'not specifically about the applicant or another person and [being] just about a class of persons of which the applicant or other person is a member' .Nicholls FM addressed the appellants' complaint that the Tribunal did not have a so-called ' fresh look ' at the subject claims to refugee status, and observed that the complaint was unsustainable, at least because the claims were framed merely as assertions involving what amounted to submissions in reality as to merits review, his Honour referring in that regard to Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259.More to the point in relation to the appellants' case on the present appeal to the Federal Court, his Honour addressed at some length issues tendered by the appellants in relation to the scope of operation of s 424A of the Migration Act , being issues which dominated the appellants' case raised by their belated written submissions provided purportedly in line with the amended notice of appeal and particulars filed in relation thereto (see again [3] above).Nicholls FM made the following further observations upon the implications of the common law rules of procedural fairness and also the operation of s 424A in relation to the present appeal: as to the common law rules of procedural fairness, the documentary material relied upon by the Tribunal, being 'CX31417' described as 'US State Department publication: Bangladesh: profile of asylum claims and country conditions, bureau of democracy, human rights and labor, February 1998', was 'exactly the same document' [as was placed] before the delegate' , and accordingly the appellants 'would therefore have already known about the existence of this document , given that [they] make reference to the file of the Department... in the application for review to the Tribunal, and [the appellants] were notified of the delegate's decision by letter attaching the same' ; that document was amongst those listed in Part B to the delegate's decision of 30 August 2001;as to the Tribunal's compilation of reasons relating to the appellants' behaviour in Bangladesh, that behaviour was inconsistent with persons having a genuine fear of persecution in Bangladesh contexts; in any event as I have elsewhere discussed, the first appellant made claims appertaining only to experience in the Dhaka district, having made no effort to relocate to any of the other 63 districts in Bangladesh beyond Dhaka; andthe Tribunal found generally that the first appellant's conduct in pursuing his claims reflected a 'catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to co-operate' , which led to the conclusion in his Honour's view that he had no fear of persecution, being a finding that his Honour considered to have been open to the Tribunal to conclude on the material placed before it, and for which conclusion the Tribunal had in any event given reasons; so much has been elsewhere referred to in these submissions upon the critical issue as to delay.Nicholls FM observed that the Tribunal had assumed '... the first appellant's claims as to what happened to him up to 1997 in Bangladesh were [still] true' .However the Tribunal had found, by reference to the independent information in evidence available at the time of decision-making compiled some six years after the appellants had left Bangladesh, 'that the circumstance [in Bangladesh] had changed to the extent that the party [of] which [the first appellant] claim [s] to be a supporter was now in government'.Moreover his Honour considered that after taking into consideration the up-dated country information, the Tribunal concluded that the legal system in Bangladesh had evolved to the stage that '... [the appellants] could eventually secure justice in circumstances where [their complaints] may be true' , so much being a further finding described by his Honour as open to the Tribunal to reach on the evidence before it.Further findings of the Tribunal recorded and relied upon by Nicholls FM below included the following (to which I have already made partial reference but repeat for completeness): the appellants could safely and reasonably relocate out of their home district (the Dhaka district) in Bangladesh to one of the other 63 districts in Bangladesh; the Tribunal was clearly conscious of the relevant test to be applied in considering the issue of relocation, namely that the Tribunal should not merely address whether an applicant could relocate to another area but whether the applicants could reasonably be expected to do so ( Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 at 442 per Black CJ); the Tribunal did look specifically at the relevant country information about population size and dispersal in Bangladesh, the dispersal and spread of relevant political parties, issues relating to politics and violence in Bangladesh, and the judiciary and police and the role they played in Bangladeshi affairs, and also the appellant husband/ father's ability to 'support himself and his family in an unfamiliar country (Australia) for almost six years' and found that it had 'no doubt' that the appellant husband had the ability 'to support himself [and his family] in the country in which he was born, and educated, spent most of his life, and still had family'.Returning therefore to the operation of s 424A and related matters arising, Nicholls FM found in summary as follows: the context of any SAAP/Al Shamry issue (the country information referred to by the Tribunal) the judiciary and politics and in the statutory context clearly fell within the exemption provided in s 424A from the obligation contained in s 424A.The Tribunal's finding on relocation was consistent with the relevant test, and open to it on the material before it.The reference above to Al Shamry was to the Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27; I have already of course made brief reference to SAAP.Nicholls FM next addressed another issue which has arisen with more attention on this appeal, which may be described as whether, even if the Tribunal had not fulfilled the requirements of s 424A of the Migration Act in relation to any ground or set of reasons upon or by reference to which the decision of the Tribunal was made, there existed at least more unimpeachable grounds or sets of reasons on which the decision had been rightly based.The Tribunal was said by his Honour to have 'clearly differentiated between at least the three sets of reasons that it gave for affirming the decision under review' .Those three grounds or sets of reasons of the Tribunal, being the subject of subpars ,  and  of par 1 of the amended notice of appeal extracted in [3] above, and described by the Tribunal as 'three good sets of reasons for concluding that the applicants have no real chance of persecution for a Convention reason if returned to Bangladesh' , are appropriate to reproduce in sequence and to the extent of virtually their entire text below: because the claims made by the applicant on key issues have changed from time to time in significant ways.To prove this point it is enough to see the differences in the claims about the applicant's employment..., place of residence..., when he reported the claimed 19 March 1997 attack... and whether there were arrest warrants issued for him.In addition, whichever version of his place of residence one believes, it is remarkable that in both versions he claims to have been at the one address for significant periods either side of the [June] 1996 election and thus was at that address at a time when he claims that he was attacked several times by the Awami League --- it is not credible that a person who is supposedly under serious sustained attack from his enemies would continue to reside at his long-term address, which is no doubt why he modified the claim about residence when he initiated his second case.The differences mentioned and this point about the address lead me to conclude that the applicant has exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation he faced and faces in Bangladesh.I attach no significance to the documents he provided because he undercut the credibility of some of them himself and the country information on page 13 and my own experience of dozens of Bangladeshi cases alert me to the notorious unreliability of such documents.because the applicant's behaviour before and after his various lodgements of claims (relating to the 1997 case and the 2001 case) has not been consistent with that of a person with a genuine fear of persecution for a Convention reason.The only places which he mentioned in relation to his political activity and the threats to him are in Dhaka district and there is no reason to suppose that he was known or threatened outside Dhaka yet he apparently made no effort to relocate within Bangladesh to one of the 63 districts outside Dhaka.He did not leave Bangladesh until over two months after he obtained his Australian visa... .When he left Bangladesh he left legally and by using a passport in his own name... .His first application for a protection visa was made in July 1997, four weeks after he arrived in June... .He did not supply a set of Convention-related claims until 22 months later, in May 1999.His oral evidence at the RRT hearing in May 1999 was unconvincing (see decision N97/18939).He did not bother to be represented at the Federal Court hearing of his appeal in September 1999.He allowed a gap of 18 months between the final end of his first case (in January 2000) and the initiation of his second case (July 2001).His statutory declaration received by DIMIA in July 2001 was simply a copy of his one submitted 26 months before....He did not respond to the July 2001 letter from DIMIA... .He has never provided the material which he promised in his September 2001 RRT application... .He did not bother to attend the 28 April 2003 RRT hearing he had promised to attend... .This catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to co-operate leads me to conclude that the applicant was in no hurry to go anywhere or to do anything because there was no reason for him to be in a hurry because he had and has no fear of persecution.because even if his claims about what happened to him in 1997 and before were true, they have been overtaken by events.He has been out of Bangladesh for six years and I see no reason to suppose that any political enemies he had then would continue to be interested in him.The party which he claims to support is now in government and the country information on pages 10 to 12 leads me to conclude that that confers advantages on its supporters in terms of benevolent treatment from the organs of the state.In terms of any legal action the applicant faces, I note that he has not been convicted of a crime or any offence... .For reasons given elsewhere in this decision I do not believe that his claim that he faces any cases (false or otherwise) is credible but if he does face a case or cases then I conclude from the country information on the judiciary... that he would eventually secure justice.Moreover any cases resulting from the politically-motivated animus of his supposed opponents during the previous Awami League administration would clearly be seen for what they are and be treated accordingly.are 64 districts in Bangladesh... .The only district he has mentioned is Dhaka district.The fact that he kept living there for so long despite the supposed threat to him leads me to conclude that he did not fear persecution there because he has exaggerated or fabricated that threat.for any reason the applicant does not wish to live in Dhaka district, the country information... leads me to conclude that there are many other parts of the country in which it would be reasonable to expect him to be able to relocate.He has managed to support himself and his family in an unfamiliar country (Australia) for almost six years so I have no doubt of his ability to support himself and them in the country in which he was born, was educated, spent most of his life and still has family.the applicant wishes to pursue politics in Bangladesh in a manner which does not involve thuggery and criminality of the sort which characterises much of Bangladeshi politics, the material... leads me to conclude that he would be able to do so and have little to fear from rival political groups, especially if he pursued such activities outside of Dhaka district.Upon the footing of each of those 'three good sets of reasons' so-called by the Tribunal, the Tribunal made supplementary observations to be read in conjunction therewith, including reference to Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 at 440-443 for the proposition, which I have already foreshadowed, that protection is not available in the case of a well-founded fear in an applicant's home region where that applicant can 'nevertheless avail [himself or herself] of the real protection of [his or her] country of nationality elsewhere within that country' .The Court added the qualification that the applicant must also be able to 'genuinely access domestic protection' , and relocation needs to be a reasonable option in the particular circumstances (see in that regard Beaumont J at 450-1).The Tribunal member concluded his reasons for decision as follows: the above reasons, I conclude that the applicant does not face Convention-related persecution in Bangladesh because there is nothing credible in his claims to indicate that he has a profile which would lead to him being wanted by the Awami League or the authorities or anyone else outside of Dhaka let alone in Dhaka.inadequacies and inconsistencies of the applicant's claims and of his behaviour in pursuit of his claims lead me to conclude that the applicant did not and does not have a genuine fear of persecution.The reasons set out above lead me to conclude that he has no well-founded fear of persecution within the meaning of the Convention.Accordingly, I am satisfied that he is not a refugee.It was partly in the context of the formulation of those 'three sets of reasons' of the Tribunal of a fundamentally factual or circumstantial character, and of his Honour's consideration of the implications thereof, that Nicholls FM concluded his reasons for judgment below by reference to what he described as the critical issue arising on the appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court, explained as follows: critical issue therefore, even if the Tribunal breached the requirements of s 424A (as understood in the context of SAAP in relation to one ground ("sets of reasons") upon which the decision was made, is whether there is one or more other grounds on which the decision was based, which cannot, or are not, impeached.That is, was there another separate basis, or bases, upon which the decisions may be supported.The Tribunal itself by the very language that it used clearly differentiated between at least three sets of reasons that it gave for affirming the decision under review.Bearing in mind the relevant authorities even if there is some difficulty in the Tribunal's first set of stated reasons (the first part of the first set), the second and third reasons, independently and separately from each other, and then the Tribunal's separate and independent finding in relation to relocation are each not in my view affected by jurisdictional error and can independently support the Tribunal's ultimate conclusion that the applicant did not satisfy the relevant criteria for a protection visa.Had I not dismissed on the basis of unwarrantable delay, I would have dismissed on this basis in any event.I have earlier of course made reference to that delay attributed by the Federal Magistrate to the appellants.It is of assistance, in the context of the complexity and detail of the reasoning and findings of the Tribunal and of Nicholls FM below, to read the conclusions of his Honour upon the four principal issues identified by his Honour in association with his summary of the Tribunal's findings appearing in [5] of his reasons for judgment below.Those issues may be described (as has been foreshadowed) first as to exaggerations and fabrications of the adult male appellant in respect of his political activism, secondly as to behaviour inconsistent with his having any genuine fear of persecution, thirdly as to recent independent country information, and fourthly as to the implications of the country information concerning safety of relocation in Bangladesh available to the appellants.Such four themes are not to be read in any mutually exclusive way, as is apparent from the text of the so-called three sets of reasons of the Tribunal ( ante ).Outline of the appellants' case presented on the appeal to the Federal Court, being principally related to contraventions or otherwise by the Minister of s 424A --- my observations and responses contextually appearing The material presented in writing by the appellants at the hearing of the appeal from the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court consisted of an amended notice of appeal and written submissions, which were provided by the appellants only several days prior to the hearing of the appeal.It is appropriate that I reproduce the text or substance (as the case may be) of the appellants' written submissions, and address such oral submissions of additional significance, as ultimately pursued by the appellants.The issues raised by the appellants in the amended notice of appeal were framed mainly in relation to their contentions as to the operation of s 424A of the Migration Act in circumstances postulated by the respective parties, and did not explicitly address the critical issue of unwarrantable delay on the part of the appellants, which latter issue was however the subject of oral submissions.The Minister submitted that the appeal could be dismissed on the basis that the issue of unwarrantable delay was not touched upon in the notice of appeal or the amended notice of appeal.Much has been written about the scope and purpose of operation of s 424A , but in my opinion two aspects thereof may be conveniently emphasised, each being highlighted in the joint judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at [23]: the Tribunal must possess [the] "information".the Tribunal must consider that that information "would be the reason, or part of the reason" for affirming the decision under review.Moreover when it becomes necessary or appropriate for the Tribunal to make findings and formulate conclusions cumulatively, though in stages, and being unavoidable in situations involving some measure of complexity of evidentiary material, such as here exemplified in relation to the three so-called 'sets of reasons' of the Tribunal (and reproduced already in these reasons at [24] above), it is of practical assistance to an implementation of the s 424A process, to bear in mind the following further observations appearing in the joint reasons for judgment of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF at [33] and [41] respectively: It commonly is the case that the detail and complexity of the case advanced by a visa applicant, and the information that is given and garnered for the purposes of considering it, results in the Tribunal being confronted with issues that may be of varying importance, relevance and centrality both to the decision to be taken and to the reasoning that in the event sustains that decision.While the reasoning process may advert to, and express views on, such issues, all will not necessarily constitute part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision.Tribunals, no less than courts, engage in their own species of dicta often enough for reasons related to haste and pressure in composition.When a Tribunal's reasons are to be evaluated for s 424A purposes, the Court as a matter of judgment is required to isolate what were the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision.That task, necessarily, is an interpretative one.In some instances the differentiation of the integral and the inessential may be by no means easy --- and made the more so by less than explicit indications in the reasons themselves as to what the tribunal itself considered to be integral.Considered in the context of the Tribunal's reasoning process and having regard to the aggregate of findings made that rejected both that the appellant had been persecuted for a Convention reason and that his situation was such as to give rise to a well founded fear of persecution, reference to the information as to his behaviour in Australia can only be categorised as being relatively minor and unimportant in the scheme of things.It was not so integral to the reasoning process rejecting the appellant's claim as to require as a matter of fairness that the appellant be told that information (cf s 424A) and why it was relevant to the review (cf s 424A).It was stated widely by the appellants at the threshold of their written submissions that Nicholls FM found that the so-called first set of reasons appearing in the Tribunal's decision 'was affected by a breach of s 424A of the [Migration Act]... as a consequence of the tribunal using information given by the first appellant [husband/father] in his protection visa application as a part of its reasons for affirming the decision of the delegate'.That first set of reasons addressed the implications of what the Tribunal described as the claims made by the applicant on key issues having 'changed from time to time in significant ways' by reason of the circumstances thereby exemplified .His Honour summarised those circumstances attending the first set of reasons as comprising or involving differences, or inconsistencies, found between details that the first appellant had put to the delegate and the account given to the Tribunal which led the Tribunal to conclude that the first appellant had exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation of harm that he faced in Bangladesh.Nicholls FM observed that the Tribunal relied on the inconsistencies in the appellants' claim in its reasons for decision rather than the information contained in the visa application and that 'in the alternative that even if [the first set of reasons] of the Tribunal's decision did not contain jurisdictional error, it did not have necessary consequence in the ultimate decision to affirm the delegate's decision, because of other independent reasons given for affirming the delegate's decision' .The submissions of the appellants by way of response to the so-called second and third sets of reasons commenced to the effect that '[i]n considering whether to grant relief, the Federal Magistrate found the other two sets of reasons for affirming the decision were not affected by the breach [of s 424A] ', and were said to have provided 'an alternative basis upon which the decision could be made'.The applicants referring thereby apparently to the Tribunal's decision that the first appellant could 'secure justice in circumstances where' he faced 'false charges' in Bangladesh, and to the Tribunal's finding as to the appellants' absence of effort to relocate outside the Dhaka district of Bangladesh to elsewhere in 'one of the 63 districts' of that country .His Honour summarised the circumstances attending the so-called second set of reasons as being 'based on [the first appellant's] behaviour both before and after the lodgement of claims in 1997 and 2001' and on the 'Tribunal's finding that his actions were not consistent with a genuine fear of persecution for Convention reasons'.His Honour observed that the Tribunal characterised 'these actions... [on the part of the appellants] as a repeated failure to provide documents and claims as promised, "unconvincing oral evidence" and a "catalogue of repeated tardiness and failure to co-operate"' (referring thereby to page 15 of the Tribunal's reasons).His Honour summarised those circumstances attending the so-called third set of reasons as being 'based on the Tribunal finding that even if the [first appellant's] claims about what happened to him in 1997, and previously, were true, that the events and situations giving rise to those claims have been overtaken by more recent events, [and that] [i] n particular the Tribunal relied on independent country information which showed that the party which the [first appellant] claimed to support was at the time of the Tribunal's consideration in government, and further that the independent information led it to conclude that this conferred an advantage on its supporters in terms of the level of treatment from the organs of the State'.That summary of his Honour continued further that 'the Tribunal found that... it did not believe the [first appellant's] claim that he faced "false cases" as being credible, but even in the event that he did face some charges, then the Tribunal concluded from the country information available to it... that he would eventually secure justice (referring thereby to pages 15 and 16 of the Tribunal's reasons).Lastly his Honour summarised the circumstances further attending the Tribunal's reasons generally that the Tribunal '... also looked at the issue of relocation and whether protection was available in another part of Bangladesh', and 'found that as the [first appellant] had only referred in his claims to one (Dhaka) of the 64 districts in Bangladesh [and] based on independent country information available to it (pages 9 and 13 of the Tribunal's reasons appearing under the heading 'Country information'), the [first appellant] would be able to safely relocate to another part of Bangladesh and that it would be reasonable to expect him to so relocate (pages 16 and 17 of the Tribunal's reasons).I should interpolate to point out the compelling force of that location observation.It was in any event in the context of the appellants' case for contravention of s 424A that the appellants drew attention to SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; (2006) 150 FCR 214 at [230] - [234] (Allsop J), where in the light of what was said in Aala and SAAP , his Honour observed as follows as to consequences flowing generally from a beach by the Minister of s 424A: Section 424A not having been complied with, the appellant is entitled to statutory writs under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 unless a legitimate reason to withhold such relief can be identified.subject to what follows, if s 424A is not complied with, the Court does not engage in an enquiry as to whether the breach was so trivial as not to warrant relief.The failure to comply with the statutorily mandated provisions leads to the conclusion that there was a lack of statutory authority to make the decision.In the operation of s 424A and the principles of procedural fairness, adherence to mandated process and procedure is vital... as a matter of discretion, relief will be withheld for reasons going to the conduct of the applicant as discussed in Aala and SAAP .No such considerations apply here... if it can be shown that there is a basis, otherwise unimpeached, upon which the decision was reached, unaffected by the failure to accord procedural fairness or to comply with the required statutory procedure, relief can be withheld.What the majority in SAAP stated was that one did not engage in an evaluative analysis of the triviality or seriousness of the failure to observe the statutory requirements.The same was said by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Aala.However, Aala and SAAP leave open... the basis to refuse relief if it can be shown that grant of relief would lack utility.The examples given... in Aala ... were: where the decision-maker was bound by the governing statute; where the submissions could only have been answered, as a matter of law, against the person denied the opportunity of making them; and if the decision under review has no legal effect.If it can be shown that there was a basis for the Tribunal's decision which can be seen to be entirely independent of the failure to follow s 424A, in my view, that is sufficiently analogous to the first of the alternatives referred to in...Aala to warrant withholding of relief.The federal magistrate concluded that the Tribunal found that "even if the claims made by the applicant were true he was not a refugee".Unlike the federal magistrate, I am unable to discern such a clear basis upon which the failure to follow s 424A had no possible effect.The influence of credit appears to me to pervade the whole of the reasons of the Tribunal.The failure to comply with s 424A has not been shown to be entirely separate from an unimpeached basis for the decision.The further issues remain therefore, first as to whether in all the circumstances, the Tribunal did contravene s 424A in the light of what was held at [233] of SZEEU above as to 'a basis for the Tribunal's decision which [is]... entirely independent of the failure to follow s 424A', and in any event, whether any discretionary factor (being delay in particular) should so operate as to deny relief to the appellants.As to the existence of any contravention of s 424A, there remains of course the issue of an absence or otherwise of operation of subsection  thereof in any of the circumstances excepted by the terms of subsection  thereof relating to '... information... not about the applicant... and... just about a class of persons of which the applicant... is a member' , or, 'information... that the applicant gave for the purpose of the application...'.It was asserted by the appellants that irrespective of the validity of the findings of the Federal Magistrate in respect of the issues raised on the appeal from the Tribunal, 'the Federal Magistrate actually dismissed the application on the basis of unwarrantable delay on the part of the appellants', and in that regard the appellants referred to the matters I have discussed in [9]-[10] above concerning what ultimately became the decisive issue of delay on the part of the appellants in their unsuccessful pursuit of the initial application for review by way of appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court.I will later address the implications of the issue arising as to delay.As to the existence of any such basis for the Tribunal's decision which was entirely independent of a failure to follow s 424A (see again [233] of SZEEU extracted above), the Minister referred to a number of Federal Court authorities exemplifying denial of relief in circumstances constituting an independent basis for a decision unaffected by breach of s 424A, including VEAJ of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 678 ; (2003) 132 FCR 291 (see in particular [54]-[55] per Gray J).Upon that footing, the Minister pointed out that Nicholls FM had concluded that not only the relocation findings, but also the remaining aspects of the Tribunal's so-called 'three good sets of reasons' , which I have reproduced earlier at [24] of my reasons, 'were unaffected by any breach of s 424A that existed in relation to the first of those separate and independent bases'.The appellants submitted in any event that 'on the basis of the following principles, an examination of the sets of reasons shows that all three sets of reasons forming the parts of the reasons for affirming the decision of the Tribunal are affected by [a] breach of s 424A', the appellants thereby referring to the reasons I have reproduced at length in [24] above.It was asserted by the appellants that '[i]nformation given to the Minister's Department [and] obtained by the Tribunal from the Department and not from [the appellants] is not subject to s 424A', and I was referred in that regard to the Full Court's reasons for judgment in Al Shamry at [17]-[18] per Ryan J and myself jointly, and at [40]-[41] per Merkel J.I reproduce below [17] of the reasons in Al Shamry for ease of reference: Counsel for the Minister accepted that a failure to observe the procedure laid down by s 424A is a reviewable error under s 476.It was also accepted that where there is information of the kind described in s 424A particulars of that information must be given to the applicant for the purpose of obtaining his or her comments.However, it was said that the information constituted by the airport interview came within the exception created by s 424A in respect of information given by the applicant for the purpose of the application.Application" in that context, was said to mean "all information given by the applicant to officials in the Department (including that provided to the Tribunal) for the purpose of determining whether to grant a protection visa to the applicant.We disagree.In our view, "applicant" wherever appearing in s 424A means "applicant for review by the Tribunal of a Ministerial decision" and "application" correspondingly means the proceeding before the Tribunal which is the vehicle for such a claim for review.It was then submitted by the appellants that '[s]uch information that the tribunal uses to make an adverse appraisal of the applicant's case requires disclosure if the appraisal is a part of the reason for affirming the decision of the delegate'.My reservation with that submission concerns the interpolation of the expression 'appraisal' in the context of the wording of s 424A .In any event in that context, the appellants cited SZEEU at [20] and [34] per Moore J, at [157]-[165] per Weinberg J, and at [221]-[225] per Allsop J for the proposition that 'a subsidiary and minor part only' of the reasons will suffice.It suffices for me to point in particular to the dictum of Weinberg J (at [164]) to the effect that the 'information' in question 'played a part' , and to Moore J's reasons where his Honour used less definitive descriptions (at [20]-[21]).The appellants asserted further that the conclusion that 'all three sets of reasons for the decision are affected by a breach of s 424A is readily determinable because the tribunal has clearly indicated in its reasons where and when it has obtained the information from the protection visa'.The appellants' submissions continued that '[t]he tribunal made no disclosure of this adverse information and in accordance with the following principles as such the whole of the decision is affected by a breach of s 424A'.As I have earlier foreshadowed, the appellants argued that the Tribunal's so-called first set of reasons constituted a breach of s 424A because the Tribunal used information given by the first appellant in his protection visa application as part of its reasons for affirming the decision of the Minister's delegate.In the course of oral submissions, counsel for the appellants pointed to the Tribunal's reliance on information regarding the first appellant's employment history, place of residence and previous arrest warrants, all being information gleaned from the first appellant's application for a protection visa, and which was purportedly used by the Tribunal in the formulation of its first set of reasons without the appellants being given prior particulars of that information, as stipulated by s 424A.That reliance of the Tribunal was undertaken in order to demonstrate differences or inconsistencies between information that the appellants had provided to the delegate of the Minister and the information subsequently given to the Tribunal, being discrepancies that consequently formed the basis of the Tribunal's finding that the first appellant had ' exaggerated or fabricated his political activism and the situation of harm that he faced in Bangladesh '.In support of the contention that information given to the Minister's Department that is obtained by the Tribunal from the Department, and not from an applicant for refugee status, is not subject to the exception contained in s 424A and therefore falls within s 424A, the appellants pointed to Merkel J's following observations at [40]-[41] in Al Shamry : An applicant for a protection visa will have provided information relevant to the outcome of the application prior to applying for the review of a delegate's decision... [f]urther, the information given may be supplemented by information provided subsequently to the Department or to the delegate of the Minister.An applicant may have no record of the information provided, but, more importantly, may not be aware of its significance to the review ultimately to be conducted by the RRT.It is therefore understandable that the legislature would require that, in fairness, any adverse information provided prior to review, the significance [his Honour's emphasis] of which the applicant may be unaware, be disclosed to the applicant to enable him or her to respond to it... .For the above reasons the construction of the primary judge and I regard as correct gives effect to the beneficial purpose of s 424A of affording an applicant with the opportunity to respond to the gravamen or substance of any adverse information upon which the RRT proposes to act, the significance of which the applicant may be unaware.It is consistent with that purpose to take a narrow, rather than a broad, view of the exceptions in s 424A.Given those observations of his Honour not being explicitly or implicitly inconsistent with the reasoning of the majority, which I will assume for the purpose of the argument, those observations underline the need for the appellant to be given particulars of any adverse information submitted prior to the application for review and on which the Tribunal proposes to rely.Further to the foregoing contention of the appellants, it was next said on their behalf that SZEEU provides authority for the proposition that s 424A will be engaged in situations where the Tribunal finds as relevant to its reasoning some inconsistency or incompatibility between earlier information provided by an applicant and evidence provided thereafter by that applicant.Weinberg J observed at [165] of SZEEU as follows: appellant's credibility was of critical importance to his claim.Any "information" that the Tribunal considered as casting serious doubt upon his credibility, whether referred to in the early stages of its reasons, or as fortifying its earlier conclusions, seems to me likely to have played "a part" in the decision.For that reason, the Tribunal's failure to provide the appellant with notice, in writing, of its intention to rely upon that "information" gave rise to a breach of s 424A, and in accordance with SAAP , to jurisdictional error.By the expression 'intention to rely', I assume that his Honour thereby referred to reliance in decision-making.Moreover Allsop J said at [225] as follows:the Tribunal finds as relevant to its reasoning some inconsistency or incompatibility between earlier information and evidence to it as relevant to its reasoning that may well engage s 424A if such inconsistency or incompatibility can be seen to have been a part of the reason for affirming the decision.It should be here recorded that the Minister's submissions conceded that '[i]n the light of SZEEU , [Nicholls FM] may have erred in the first part of [28] where he seems to accept a distinction between relying upon inconsistencies to reach a conclusion rather than the underlying information'.However Nicholls FM went on to observe (at [28]), germane to the issues here arising for resolution, as follows:I am also persuaded... in the alternative that even if this part of the Tribunal's decision did contain jurisdictional error, it did not have necessary consequence in the ultimate decision to affirm the delegate's decision... For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal's decision can be upheld on the basis of other independent sets of reasons given by the Tribunal, and that any such error, if it does exist in this first set of the Tribunal's reasons, cannot be a basis for setting aside the Tribunal's decision.His Honour referred in that regard to VEAJ ( ante ).Counsel for the appellants in oral submissions further contended that the second and third sets of reasons (see again [24] above) were also affected by a breach of s 424A because they similarly relied upon information obtained from the appellants' protection visa application.The Tribunal's statement that the appellant ' did not leave Bangladesh until over two months after he obtained his Australian visa' was asserted by the appellant to be one of the observations within the Tribunal's second set of reasons that was based on information contained in the protection visa application and which was said by the appellants to have involved a breach of s 424A.The appellants' further contended that such a finding amounted to 'a part' of the reason of the Tribunal , SZEEU at [158] per Weinberg J and at [225] per Allsop J being relied upon to support their argument that 'a minor and subsidiary part' of the reasons is all that is needed for a breach of s 424A to arise.There is some force in that submission by the appellant.The breach of s 424A that was said by the appellants to arise out of the Tribunal's third set of reasons for decision (see again [24] above) was related to the first appellant's claim that he would face legal action if he returned to Bangladesh.In rejecting that claim, the Tribunal member observed that '[i] n terms of any legal action the applicant faces, I note that he has not been convicted of a crime or any offence' .The appellants submitted that the Tribunal relied on information contained in the first appellant's protection visa application that indicated he had not been convicted of any crimes, and that such a finding formed 'part of the [Tribunal's] reason, because it goes to an integer of the claim and [is] information which requires disclosure under section 424A...'.The Minister contended that while the information regarding the first appellant's previous criminal convictions is 'on the face of it...something which the applicant said to DIMIA', the subsequent statement made by the Tribunal suggested that independent country information formed the basis of the reasoning used to dispel the appellants' claim regarding possible future criminal prosecution.The Tribunal stated in that regard as follows: reasons given elsewhere in this decision I do not believe that his claim that he faces any cases (false or otherwise) is credible but if he does face a case or cases then I conclude from the country information on the judiciary on page 12 that he would eventually secure justice.The Minister submitted that 'because of that word " but "... and reading that paragraph in context, the Tribunal is saying, well, on the one hand I note that he has not been convicted of any crime or offence, but then saying even if he had been, then because of the independent [country] information on the judiciary no harm is going to come to him'.There is force in that submission of the Minister, and upon reading that paragraph as a whole, it would appear that the Tribunal's reasoning was indeed based on independent country information, rather than the first appellant's application visa.The Tribunal's findings in relation to relocation contained in the final or third of the three sets of reasons were in any event not visited with jurisdictional error, since they were based on country information that fell within the exception to disclosure contained in s 424A.The Tribunal's findings additionally as to the appellants' delay and otherwise as to discretion factors --- the respective submissions of the parties On the footing of the appellants' case that all three of the Tribunal's so-called 'three good sets of reasons' were to no avail because of the Minister's contravention of s 424A of the Migration Act , the appellants asserted that '... the determinative issue on appeal is whether there was unwarrantable delay on the part of the appellants disentitling them from the grant of relief'.I would interpolate the description 'ultimate' for 'determination', for what that may matter.I have already summarised the evidentiary material bearing upon that issue of delay.The appellants seemingly acknowledged that Nicholls FM 'found the delay unwarrantable because it was for a period of 13&#189; months between notification of the decision of the tribunal and the application for review', and further that his Honour found that 'no explanation for the delay was given despite being sought', and moreover that the appellants 'were not unfamiliar with the application process' and their delay '... was inconsistent with the action of someone who fears persecution and claims to [be] aggrieved by the Tribunal'.So much may be in any event inferred from the evidence placed before his Honour.The rejoinder of the appellants to those findings of the Tribunal was, somewhat confusingly, that Nicholls FM '... miscarried in his discretion to not grant the relief sought', because '[r]ather than ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified withholding the relief in the event that [the] appellants established that the tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error, the Federal Magistrate proceeded on the basis that the appellants were required to satisfy the Court that the discretion should be exercised in [their] favour having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded 13&#189; months'.The reality apparent from the objective circumstances was that the appellants had no viable answer to the Minister's case on delay.Reliance was placed by the appellants upon what was said by Sackville J in SZHJR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 203 , where his Honour held at [19] and [22] as follows (so far as is material): It seems to me that the Magistrate proceeded on an erroneous assumption, namely, that the appellant had to persuade the Court to exercise a discretion in his favour before it could consider whether the RRT had indeed committed a jurisdictional error.The correct position was that the Magistrate had a discretion to withhold relief on various grounds, including unjustified delay, even if the appellant established that the RRT's decision was affected by a jurisdictional error.The difficulty with the approach of the Magistrate is that he did not ask whether the circumstances of the delay justified the withholding of relief in the event that the appellant established that the RRT had committed a jurisdictional error.Rather, the cases upon which he relied suggest that he required the appellant to satisfy the Court that discretion should be exercised in his favour, having regard to the fact that the delay exceeded one year.On any view, the appellant was guilty of long delay and no satisfactory excuse was or could be proffered for that delay.But the question asked by the Magistrate, in my view, was not the correct one and this led to his miscarrying of this issue.In my opinion and contrary to the thrust of the appellants' submissions, Nicholls FM did enquire as to whether the circumstance of the delay justified the withholding of the relief in the event that the appellants established that the Tribunal had committed a jurisdictional error, and hence his Honour did meet the substance of the test as articulated by Sackville J above.Nicholls FM invited the appellants to comment on why their application was delayed, an invitation that ultimately led the first appellant to respond 'I have nothing to say regarding this matter'.His Honour proceeded thereafter to explore the issue of jurisdictional error.Incidentally I do not understand Nicholls FM to have relied merely on the fact of 13&#189; months per se, but rather upon the circumstances which he had otherwise comprehensively reviewed in his reasons for judgment contextually to that delay.The appellants contended next that what his Honour was primarily required to consider was whether 'the circumstances of the case made the withholding of [relief] the proper course', given that '[t]he writ issues as of right unless it is unjust to withhold it', the appellants citing in that regard R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 400, and Aala at [51]-[52] and [56] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ.In cases of unwarrantable delay, so the appellants' submissions on the subject of delay proceeded, the exercise the Court was required to undertake included 'weighing the primary consideration of ensuring the legality of government action against the secondary consideration of the finality of litigation', the appellants further citing respectively Aala at [55] (Gaudron and Gummow JJ).That scope of finding by Nicholls J referrable to delay was however in my opinion clearly open to his Honour to find, at least in the circumstances to which his Honour referred.I am unable to accept that his Honour did not pay regard to considerations that were appropriate to the circumstances of the case.Further as to any issue concerning the grant or withholding of relief in the exercise of discretion, the appellants submitted that the onus rests on the Minister to persuade the court not to grant the relief sought by the appellants, assuming of course the existence of any such entitlement to relief, the appellants referring thereby to relief in their favour that the decision of the Tribunal be quashed, and that the Tribunal thereafter proceed to review the Minister's refusal of the protection visa according to law.The appellants cited in that context Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Miah [2001] HCA 22 ; (2001) 206 CLR 57 at [151] per Kirby J, where the majority decision of the High Court inclusive of his Honour was to the effect that the Minister's delegate had failed to accord natural justice to an applicant for migration relief.The appellants' submissions continued that '[w]hilst the Federal Magistrate did seek an explanation from the appellant, his approach was erroneous [and] did not demonstrate an onus on the [Minister], [and] further the answers of the appellant[s] made reference to some fault in an authority yet given his lack of advice on the point it is not clear under what apprehension as to the purpose of the questioning the appellant was under'.The appellants' submissions continued further to the effect that '[a] broad common sense approach is appropriate when the conduct of a party seeking review is impugned for the purpose of establishing that there are discretionary reasons why the relief should not be granted', and further that '[t]he applicant is entitled to take advantage of particular circumstances as they appear to him at the time without losing the right to have an unlawful decision set aside', the appellants citing inter alia thereby Peko-Wallsend Ltd v Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (1985) 5 FCR 532 at 561 per Sheppard J.The appellants yet further contended that 'the weight that can be placed upon the explanation is diminishable and affects the required confidence of the Court in refusing relief'.To the extent that those submissions were not somewhat tautological or at least confusing, I am unable to distil any force therein, and have only recorded the submissions by way of deference to counsel.Counsel for the appellant advanced the yet further submission that the manner in which the Federal Magistrate 'obtained the explanation for the delay [from the appellant] was not judicial because he took the information from the bar table'.It was submitted in that regard that by obtaining the husband/father's explanation for the relevant delay in that manner, the Federal Magistrate was putting himself 'in the position of an advocate or an inquisitor and...that [that] process [was] not sufficiently judicial...'.In support of that submission, reliance was placed on what appears from the unreported reasons for judgment of Jacobson J in SZGZW v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 457 , where at [45], his Honour observed, in relation to a delay of eight years from 1996 to 2005 in applying for review of an adverse Tribunal decision, as follows: It follows from what I have said, that the discretion to refuse relief miscarried within the well known principle stated in House v R [1936] HCA 40 ; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505.It was not open to the learned Federal Magistrate to find that the appellant's delay was lengthy or unsatisfactory upon the basis of untested statements made from the bar table.Aside from whatever may have been the content of the 'untested statements made from the bar table' in SZGZW , and irrespective of what the objective circumstances might have evinced in any event, the context of the present case can be distinguished from that addressed by Jacobson J in SZGZW , in that his Honour was there addressing circumstances where the Tribunal had challenged an assertion made by the appellant upon the basis solely of statements made by that appellant from the bar table.Jacobson J observed at [39]-[40] and [41] of SZGZW (so far as is material) as follows: the difficulty with the approach which the Federal Magistrate adopted was that he made findings of fact without hearing any evidence from the appellant.He acted solely upon submissions from the bar table and without testing any of the statements which were made to him by an unrepresented applicant.as a general rule, the judicial power of the Commonwealth cannot be exercised to deny relief for admitted jurisdictional error, consisting as it does in this case, of a denial of statutory procedural fairness, without evidence tested in the ordinary way.That is especially so in the present case because the learned Federal Magistrate apparently did not believe the explanation proffered from the bar table.The appellant's overall explanation for his delay was that he did not know of the decision until 28 November 2005.The Federal Magistrate cannot have believed this because he proceeded on the basis that the appellant knew of the decision either from 1996 or at least when the unsuccessful request was made under s 417.In the decision below, Nicholls FM did rely upon the content of the appellants' application and amended application filed with the Federal Magistrates Court when determining the issue of unwarrantable delay, rather than merely ' relying solely on submissions from the bar table ', and his Honour invited the appellant to address or explain the delay otherwise prima facie objectively evident, yet the appellants declined to provide any such explanation.Nicholls FM stated at [9] of his reasons for decision as follows: the case before me the applicant clearly confirmed having notice of the Tribunal decision complained of on 21 May 2003.This is clearly stated both in the application and amended application.The application to this Court was filed well over 13 &#189; months later on 14 July 2004.At the hearing before me I specifically drew the applicant's attention to the issue of delay in bringing these proceedings to this Court and the possibility of how the discretion to grant or refuse the relief sought may be affected by this.I urged the applicant to address or explain the delay.The applicant's response was: I won't say anything regarding this long period, like 12 to 13 month's delay, I have nothing to say whatsoever".I pressed the issue he made a reference to "some authority who made the delay".But when I sought an explanation the final response was: I have nothing to say regarding this matter".I do not think that the observations of Jacobson J made in SZGZW may be transposed to the context in which this first appellant responded as above as recorded by Nicholls FM.No factors or circumstances have been advanced by the appellants which would in my opinion operate to require the exercise of discretion in their favour upon any basis articulated on the appeal.Conclusions In making observations upon and responses otherwise to the numerous evidentiary and forensic issues arising, I have borne in mind the distinction drawn by Sackville J in Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 , and later approved in Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at [95] by Allsop J (Heerey J agreeing), to the effect that the information of which particulars must be provided to the appellant by the Tribunal, in accordance with s 424A , does not include the subjective appraisal or thought process of the Tribunal.I have also borne in mind that the subsection extends not just to the reason but also to a part of the reason .I am of the opinion that it was open reasonably to Nicholls FM to have dismissed the appellants' application for review of the Tribunal decision below at least upon the basis, objectively found by his Honour, as to unwarrantable delay, particularly in the light of no reasonable nor realistic endeavour on the appellants' part to establish any justifiable basis for that evident delay.The circumstances reviewed by his Honour and earlier summarised in [9]-[10] above operate to adequately support that finding of his Honour.Apart from the objective circumstances relied upon by his Honour in exemplification of unwarrantable delay, being circumstances mainly of the adult male appellant which are to be correspondingly attributable in principle to his wife and child appellants in the circumstances of the case, there was present the factor, as the Tribunal additionally mentioned and his Honour duly accepted, of his extent of familiarity with the Tribunal process gained in the context of his prior invocation of that process four years earlier, and of his prior unsuccessful application for review of that process by the Federal Court back in 1999.Although it is evident that the adult male appellant was the dominant litigant, his wife and child must bear the consequences of his role in the curial applications and appeals which have been undertaken by each of them as applicants/appellants.As the Minister rightly submitted, a refusal of relief on discretionary grounds, in particular as to delay, may occur at the instance of the decision-maker in a context of administrative review (or indeed subsequent appeal), with or without the need for the Court to determine whether or not there may have been independently established jurisdictional error in relation to the relevant decision-making of the Tribunal and Federal Magistrate that has occurred.I am unable to distil any prevailing facts or circumstance which have operated to subvert the implications and consequences of that delay.It is established by authority, which need not be cited, that a discretionary ground for withholding prerogative relief includes that of delay in the seeking of that and any associated relief.One example cited was R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal ex parte Fowler (1980) 31 ALR 565 at 570 (Barwick CJ, Gibbs, Stephen, Mason and Aickin JJ).Independently of the factor of delay, I am in any event of the opinion, for reasons appearing cumulatively in the course of my consideration and appraisal already of the s 424A issues extensively raised by the appellants and debated seriatim by the respective parties, being the issues I have already discussed at some length, that the appellants have not established that all three of the Tribunal's independent grounds for dismissing the appellants' visa applications, as articulated in the Tribunal's 'three good sets of reasons', breach s 424A of the Migration Act .Reference should again be made in that regard to SZEEU at [231], where Allsop J observed that where there can be shown an independent basis, 'otherwise unimpeached, upon which the decision was reached... relief can be withheld'.The existence of the unimpeached third set of reasons of the Tribunal's reasons for judgment thus operates as a basis upon which relief can be withheld, regardless of any finding of unwarrantable delay.In the present litigation, the task of the second Tribunal in establishing and assigning significance to the extensive array of circumstances placed before it was a formidable one, as the three grounds or sets of reasons of the Tribunal below, extracted in [24] above, have duly exemplified.No sufficient or adequate basis for any successful appeal from the reasons for decision of the Federal Magistrates Court have been established by the appellants, for the reasons apparent from my analysis of the issues arising and circumstances prevailing, and which I have addressed in the two preceding segments of these reasons.Because of the number and extent of the issues raised by the appellants on this appeal, and which I have resolved in favour of the Minister, it is unnecessary to repeat the same in the context of these conclusions.The appeal must be dismissed, and the appellants ordered to pay the Minister's costs of the appeal.</doc>

the Commissioner, having regard to any connection between any 2 or more of the parties to the agreement or to any other relevant circumstances, is satisfied that the parties to the agreement, or any 2 or more of those parties, were not dealing at arm's length with each other in relation to the supply; consideration was received or receivable by the taxpayer in respect of the supply but the amount of that consideration was less than the arm's length consideration in respect of the supply; and the Commissioner determines that this subsection should apply in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the supply, then, for all purposes of the application of this Act in relation to the taxpayer, consideration equal to the arm's length consideration in respect of the supply shall be deemed to be the consideration received or receivable by the taxpayer in respect of the supply.Where --- a taxpayer has supplied property under an international agreement; the Commissioner, having regard to any connection between any 2 or more of the parties to the agreement or to any other relevant circumstances, is satisfied that the parties to the agreement, or any 2 or more of those parties, were not dealing at arm's length with each other in relation to the supply; no consideration was received or receivable by the taxpayer in respect of the supply; and the Commissioner determines that this subsection should apply in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the supply, then, for all purposes of the application of this Act in relation to the taxpayer, consideration equal to the arm's length consideration in respect of the supply shall be deemed to have been received and receivable by the taxpayer in respect of the supply at the time when the property was supplied or, as the case requires, any of the property was first supplied, or at such later time or times as the Commissioner considers appropriate.Where --- a taxpayer has acquired property under an international agreement; ... For the purposes of this section, where, for any reason (including an insufficiency of information available to the Commissioner), it is not possible or not practicable for the Commissioner to ascertain the arm's length consideration in respect of the supply or acquisition of property, the arm's length consideration in respect of the supply or acquisition shall be deemed to be such amount as the Commissioner determines.The word "property" was defined broadly in s 136AA.Importantly, the notion of arm's length consideration was relevantly defined in s 136AA as follows:a reference to the arm's length consideration in respect of the supply of property is a reference to the consideration that might reasonably be expected to have been received or receivable as consideration in respect of the supply if the property had been supplied under an agreement between independent parties dealing at arm's length with each other in relation to the supply; ..." Central to the resolution of the issue for decision are ss 175 and 177, in particular, s 177, of the ITAA, and s 14ZZO of the TAA.Before I set out those provisions, I note that in the substance they have been part of the Australian income tax r&eacute;gime since at least the enactment of the ITAA in 1936.The only change in these provisions since 1936 has resulted from the enactment of Pt IVC of the TAA with effect from 1 March 1992 (effected by Act No 216 of 1991).Since that time, Pt IVC of the TAA has governed objections, reviews and appeals, in place of provisions within the ITAA.Whereas s 14ZZO of the TAA now provides that in proceedings on an appeal to this Court against an appealable objection, the appellant has the burden of proving that the assessment is "excessive", previously it was s 190 of the ITAA that contained a similar provision.Sections 175 and 177 of the ITAA provide:The validity of any assessment shall not be affected by reason that any of the provisions of this Act have not been complied with.The production of a notice of assessment, or of a document under the hand of the Commissioner, a Second Commissioner, or a Deputy Commissioner, purporting to be a copy of a notice of assessment, shall be conclusive evidence of the due making of the assessment and, except in proceedings under Part IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 on a review or appeal relating to the assessment, that the amount and all the particulars of the assessment are correct.CONSIDERATION General The Commissioner relies on two grounds in the alternative in support of his submission that the motions should be dismissed.The first is that by reason of ss 175 and 177 of the ITAA, the Commissioner's reasoning process leading to his making the determinations is not an issue in the proceeding, is not subject to judicial review in the appeal, and is not to be inquired into.According to this contention, the Taxpayers are not at liberty to attempt to show that the Commissioner's determinations were not authorised by the ITAA because the Commissioner took into account irrelevant considerations or did not take into account relevant considerations.If this is right, it would seem to follow that the Commissioner would not be liable to give discovery, and the Taxpayers would not be entitled to tender evidence or to cross-examine, with a view to establishing that he did or did not.Secondly, and in the alternative, the Commissioner contends that if the first ground should not find favour, nonetheless he should not be required to give particulars because ss 177 of the ITAA and 14ZZO of the TAA have the effect that the Commissioner need not propound the due making of the determination as part of a positive case to be made by him.Rather, he is entitled to rely, as he does, on his assessments, leaving it to the Taxpayers to discharge the onus incumbent on them of proving that the assessments are excessive.To express the matter differently, it is not the Commissioner but the Taxpayers who must fail unless a positive case is made out, and particulars may only be required of a positive case.Division 13 Division 13 was introduced into Part III of the ITAA following the introduction of Pt IVA.The explanatory memorandum for the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1982  stated (at 4):The revised Division 13, which this Bill will insert into the Principal Act, is designed ... to provide in the international area a general supplement to the new Part IVA of the Principal Act.Because of policy and technical inter-relationships between the two, a number of the now proposed provisions draw on the measures contained in Part IVA.In his Second Reading Speech on the Bill, the then Treasurer described Div 13 as follows (Cth, Parliamentary Debates, HR, 24 March 1982, 1367-8):Although complementary to Part IVA, the proposed measures are not limited in scope to arrangements that have a dominant tax avoidance purpose.In that regard, it is important to recognise that an arrangement to shift profits out of Australia may be entered into for a complex mixture of tax and other reasons.However, ... the fact that tax saving is not a key purpose of the particular arrangement or transaction is no reason why we, as a nation, should not be in a position to counteract any loss of the Australian revenue inherent in it.The main requirements for the application of the revised provisions are that a taxpayer has supplied, or acquired property or services under an 'international agreement', one or more of the parties to which were not dealing at arm's length with each other, and that the supply or acquisition was at prices other than those that might have been expected in a transaction between independent parties dealing independently --- that is, at arm's length.In his Statement of Facts, Issues and Contentions ("SFIC") in each proceeding, the Commissioner states that he made determinations pursuant to:ss 136AD and 136AD; orss 136AD and 136AD.That is to say, he relies on the "less than arm's length consideration" and the "no consideration" provisions, in the alternative.By the present motions, the Taxpayers seek orders that the Commissioner provide particulars of  the matters he took into account in making the determinations in respect of each of the Taxpayers.The structure of Div 13 is clear.There are "par  determinations" provided for in subss  and , as well as subs , of s 136AD, and a determination provided for in subs  of that section.The par  determinations are identical, mutatis mutandis : "the Commissioner determines that this subsection should apply in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the [ "supply",  "supply", or  "acquisition"]".Subsections  and  are concerned with a supply of property for less than "the arm's length consideration" (subs ) or for no consideration (subs ); subs , not presently relevant, is concerned with an acquisition of property for more than "the arm's length consideration".There are four conditions that must be fulfilled in order for the operative terms of either subss  or  to be enlivened.In the case of subs , for example, the conditions are:that the taxpayer has supplied property under an international agreement (the Taxpayers do not dispute that this condition was satisfied, although there is a question as to the identity of the particular international agreement under which the supply took place);that the Commissioner is satisfied that the parties were not dealing at arm's length (again, this condition is not in issue --- it is not disputed that the Commissioner was so satisfied);that the amount of the consideration received or receivable by the taxpayer was less than the arm's length consideration in relation to the supply (this condition is in issue);that the Commissioner determined that subs  should apply in relation to the taxpayer in relation to the supply (the Taxpayers concede that there were purported par  determinations, but contend that they were not in fact authorised by the ITAA, for the reason, in particular, that the Commissioner took into account irrelevant considerations and failed to take into account relevant considerations).There is but one condition that enlivens the Commissioner's power to make a determination under subs , namely, the objective circumstance that "it is not possible or not practicable for the Commissioner to ascertain the arm's length consideration ...".According to subs , if it is not possible or practicable to do so, the arm's length consideration is deemed by the subsection to be "such amount as the Commissioner determines".Since conditions  and  above are not in issue, condition  is critical.Central to condition  is identification of "the arm's length consideration".The Taxpayers submit that if the Commissioner's reasons for a determination under subs  are not examinable, it will follow that the fulfilment of condition  will not be examinable either.The Commissioner concedes that the Taxpayers are able to challenge the existence of the condition precedent to the exercise of the Commissioner's power under subs .He contends that if they are unsuccessful, that is to say, by failing to show that it was, after all, possible and practicable for the Commissioner to ascertain the arm's length consideration, the Taxpayers will, so the Commissioner's submission goes, be fixed, for the purposes of condition , with whatever amount the Commissioner has determined under subs  to be the arm's length consideration.For convenience, I will call the arm's length consideration as defined in s 136AA the "actual arm's length consideration", and that determined by the Commissioner under s 136AD, the "deemed arm's length consideration".The r&eacute;gime proceeds on the basis that in any case, the actual arm's length consideration exists as an objective fact in the real world, and that any dispute over the amount of it can be determined by the Court on evidence in the usual way.It is only if it is not possible or not practicable for the Commissioner to ascertain the amount of the actual arm's length consideration that there can be a deemed arm's length consideration.Whether it is not possible or practicable for him to do so is also an objective criterion.The Taxpayers submit that the legislature must have intended that, in order to render his par  and subs  determinations examinable, the Commissioner be bound, upon request, to disclose the matters he took into account in making those determinations.The Taxpayers have been supplied with copies of documents recording the determinations.There are two documents applicable to each Taxpayer, one under s 136AD (less than arm's length consideration) and one under s 136AD (no consideration).Accordingly, to take the case of WRCH, there was one determination under s 136AD that s 136AD (less than arm's length consideration) should apply in relation to the year of income ended 30 June 1987, and another determination under s 136AD that s 136AD (no consideration) should apply in relation to that year of income.The two documents in relation to WRCA in relation to the year of income ended 30 June 1993 were the same, mutatis mutandis .In the case of each of the four documents, the Commissioner recorded as a fact that it was not possible or "practical" (sic --- practicable) to ascertain the actual arm's length consideration.Under s 136AD, the Commissioner determined the deemed arm's length consideration ($17,897,644 in the case of WRCH, and $986,180 in the case of WRCA).The "arm's length consideration" first referred to in s 136AD is the actual arm's length consideration.If it is possible and practicable for the Commissioner to ascertain that amount, the "arm's length consideration" referred to in s 136AD will be that amount, but, if it is not possible or not practicable for the Commissioner to do so, it will be the amount of the deemed arm's length consideration.Proof of excessiveness of assessment The Taxpayers seek to bring down the Commissioner's determinations.If it is permitted to them to do so and they succeed in doing so, the present assessments will be shown to be excessive to the extent of the deemed arm's length considerations included in them.In saying this, I am assuming that their evidence will exclude the possibility of income from other sources that might "replace" the deemed arm's length considerations.The Taxpayers seek to bring down each determination in two ways:  by showing that the objective conditions that enliven the Commissioner's powers to make the determination did not exist; and  by showing that the Commissioner took into account irrelevant considerations or failed to take into account relevant considerations in making the determinations.As to , in their notices of objection, the Taxpayers assert, inter alia , that the actual arm's length consideration was received for the supply and that it was possible and practicable for the Commissioner to ascertain that actual arm's length consideration.As to , in their notices of objection, the Taxpayers identify irrelevant considerations to which they say the Commissioner had regard, and relevant considerations to which they say he failed to have regard, when making his various par  and subs  determinations.Although the Taxpayers do not know what matters the Commissioner in fact took into account, in their SFICs they have, as far as practicable, particularised both irrelevant matters that he was bound not to take into account and relevant matters that he was bound to take into account (WRCH's SFIC, par 99 and following; WRCA's SFIC, par 44 and following).Each Taxpayer has added, however, that particulars of the matters considered by the Commissioner would be sought "to confirm the Applicant's understanding".In their written submissions, the Taxpayers submit that the following are relevant matters that the Commissioner was bound to take into account in deciding whether to make the par  determinations:whether there was any tax avoidance or profit shifting purpose in relation to the transactions;whether the Australian revenue was disadvantaged as a result of the transactions;the total consideration provided in respect of the transactions.They give the following as examples of irrelevant matters that the Commissioner was bound not to take into account in making the par  determinations:a part only of the international agreement; and a subs  determination of a deemed arm's length consideration where that determination had miscarried.Apparently, the Taxpayers do not know, in the absence of particulars, whether the Commissioner took into account matters of either class (although the Taxpayers' SFICs state that they are aware that the Commissioner has concluded that the Australian revenue was disadvantaged as a result of the transactions at issue).The Commissioner submits that the Div 13 r&eacute;gime does not make his process of reasoning in arriving at a determination an element going to the substantive tax liability of the Taxpayers.He emphasises, and the Taxpayers do not dispute, that there are the following objective conditions of the operation of subss 136AD, , and , that are open to be challenged by a taxpayer in a proceeding under Pt IVC of the TAA:that the taxpayer in fact supplied property under an international agreement;that the Commissioner was in fact satisfied that the parties were not dealing at arm's length in relation to the supply;that it was not in fact possible or practicable for the Commissioner to ascertain the actual arm's length consideration;that the Commissioner did in fact determine on a deemed arm's length consideration;if the challenge to  succeeds), that the consideration received or receivable by the taxpayer in respect of the supply was in fact less than the actual arm's length consideration (s 136AD), or that in fact no consideration was received or receivable by the taxpayer in respect of the supply (s 136AD);that the Commissioner did in fact purport to determine that subs 136AD or , as the case may be, should apply to the taxpayer in respect of the supply.If the thought processes of the Commissioner which underlay the making of his determinations are within the expression "the due making" in s 177 in these Pt IVC proceedings, then whether the Commissioner had regard to irrelevant considerations or failed to have regard to relevant considerations cannot be put in issue by the Taxpayers.Although they would be entitled to prove the excessiveness of the assessments by bringing down the determinations by demonstrating that the objective conditions mentioned earlier were not fulfilled, they would not be able to do so by proving that the Commissioner's antecedent procedure involved taking into account irrelevant considerations or failing to take into account relevant considerations.As noted earlier, the Commissioner's alternative case is that even if the "due making" of the assessment does not shield from attack the Commissioner's thought processes antecedent to the making of the determinations, the Taxpayers are still not entitled to particulars sought because the due making of them is not something the Commissioner needs to prove; rather, the taxpayers must prove that they were not duly made.Order 12, r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ("FCRs") provides:The Court may order a party to file and serve on any other party --- particulars of any claim, defence or other matter stated in his pleading, or in any affidavit ordered to stand as his pleading; or a statement of the nature of the case on which he relies; or where he claims damages, particulars relating to general or other damages.Order 12, r 5 is not applicable because an SFIC is not a pleading, notwithstanding the inclusory nature of the definition of "pleading" in O 1, r 4 of the FCRs.If an appeal against an objection decision proceeded on pleadings, the taxpayer would go first with a statement of claim, followed by the Commissioner's defence, followed by any reply by the taxpayer.Moreover, O 11, r 2 of the FCRs would apply to require, for example, that the statement of claim or defence contain only a statement in a summary form of the material facts on which the taxpayer or Commissioner relies.In an article, "Anatomy of a Federal Court Tax Case" (2000) 23 UNSW Law Journal 237 at 238-9, the late Justice Bryan Beaumont discussed similarities and differences between a pleading and an SFIC.In my view, however, the Court has implied power to order particulars (cf the reference to "inherent" power to order particulars in Master Butchers Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1974] 1 NSWLR 350 at 356 (Mahoney J) (" Master Butchers "); Bailey and Ors v Commissioner of Taxation [1977] HCA 11 ; (1977) 136 CLR 214 at 221 (Jacobs J), 227, 231 (Aickin J)) (" Bailey ").Order 52B, r 5, introduced with effect on 1 March 1992, provided, relevantly, that within 28 days after service of a sealed copy of the taxpayer's application, the Commissioner must file "a statement outlining succinctly the Commissioner's contentions and the facts and issues in the appeal as the Commissioner perceives them.The requirement was introduced for historical reasons, which no longer apply, and also for a practical reason.The practical reason was a concern that the Court should know, at the earliest time practicable, the nature of the real issues in a tax appeal.The usual practice was and is for the Court, at the first or a subsequent directions hearing, to direct that the taxpayer also file and serve an SFIC.However, the sequence in which SFICs are filed and served should not be allowed to mislead (as from 1 December 2005, r 5 has required the Commissioner to file, at the Commissioner's choice, either an SFIC ("Appeal Statement") or an affidavit in support of the making of directions departing from the r&eacute;gime just described ("Appeal Affidavit"): see Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No.As Practice Note No 22, "Appeals against Appealable Objection Decisions made under the Taxation Administration Act 1953 " (made on 1 December 2005) puts it:Practitioners are reminded that nothing in the Rules or this Note can affect the operation of s 14ZZO of the Act, which provides that in proceedings on an appeal to the Court against an appealable objection decision the appellant ('applicant' in the Court): is, unless the Court orders otherwise, limited to the grounds stated in the taxation objection to which the decision relates; and has the burden of proving the matters referred to in s 14ZZO, such as, if the taxation decision concerned is an assessment (other than a franking assessment), that the assessment is excessive.In a sense, the taxpayer can be seen to have "gone first" by reason of the provision in s 14ZZO of the TAA limiting the taxpayer, unless the Court orders otherwise, to the grounds stated in the taxation objection.No doubt, many descriptions of the purpose of particulars can be found.It suffices to refer to that given by Isaacs J in R v Associated Northern Collieries &amp; Ors [1910] HCA 61 ; (1910) 11 CLR 738 (" Northern Collieries ") at 740:I take the fundamental principle to be that the opposite party shall always be fairly apprised of the nature of the case he is called upon to meet, shall be placed in possession of its broad outlines and the constitutive facts which are said to raise his legal liability.He is to receive sufficient information to ensure a fair trial and to guard against what the law terms 'surprise' ...I see no meaningful distinction between inquiring whether the Commissioner should be required to give the particulars sought, and inquiring whether his SFIC is inadequate for not having included them: cf the taxpayer's notice of motion in Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2004) 55 ATR 321 at 329, which sought an order that the Commissioner file and serve an SFIC "in compliance with O 52B, r 5 of the Federal Court Rules ".In the present case, the Taxpayers know what the Commissioner's case is.They know that he relies on the assessments and ss 175 and 177 of the ITAA.The Commissioner's SFIC in each proceeding states:The Commissioner relies on s. 14ZZO of the [TAA] and requires the Applicant ... to discharge its burden of proving the assessment is excessive.Nothing in this statement constitutes an admission of any fact or matter, or otherwise limits the operation of s 14ZZO of the TAA.The Commissioner reserves the right to supplement, vary or replace this statement to meet the submissions of [the taxpayer] or if further information comes to his attention that warrants such a course.Without prejudice to that position, the Commissioner relies on the fact that he made the various determinations, copies of which he has provided to the Taxpayers.Section 136AD does not make the antecedent procedure of the making of the determinations an element of liability to tax: it makes only the actual making of them an element of that liability, and, accordingly, the Commissioner relies only on the fact, not the process, of the making of them.The question is whether the Commissioner must provide particulars, not of something on which he relies, but with a view to equipping the Taxpayers with information on the basis of which they may be able to bring down the determinations and thereby establish that the assessments are excessive.This would be an unusual role for particulars, akin to discovery or interrogatories in relation to an issue raised by the party seeking such procedural aid.It is asserted by the Commissioner in submissions that the Taxpayers have, in substance, already had discovery of the documents that were before the Commissioner, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 .The authorities Recently in Syngenta Crop Protection Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 61 ATR 186 (" Syngenta "), a case in which the taxpayer also sought particulars of the kind sought here, Gyles J observed (at 188):I do not propose to track through all the authorities or endeavour to reconcile all of the statements in them on the topic.Such statements are not always easy to reconcile, partly because appeals cover many situations.I agree with the second sentence, although I will refer below, in chronological order, to those authorities which seem to me to be the most important.Two matters should be noted at the outset:Subsection 177 of the ITAA expressly recognises a distinction between reviews or appeals under Pt IVC of the TAA and other proceedings, in relation to the conclusive evidence of the due making of an assessment that is provided by production of a notice of the assessment.The reason is that s 14ZZO within Pt IVC contemplates that if an assessment is excessive, the taxpayer should, in a proceeding under that part, have the opportunity of proving that it is.The tension between s 177 of the ITAA on the one hand, and s 14ZZO of the TAA (or its predecessor, s 190 of the ITAA) on the other hand, permeates the cases.It will prove to be important to identify precisely the conditions of tax liability specified in the ITAA, and to distinguish between provisions referring to the Commissioner's state of mind, eg his "opinion", or his being "satisfied" or "not satisfied", on the one hand, and provisions referring to his taking a step, such as making a "determination" or "decision" on the other hand.I will refer to them as "state of mind" and "Commissioner's determination" classes of cases, respectively.Avon Downs Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1949] HCA 26 ; (1949) 78 CLR 353 (" Avon Downs "), a state of mind case, was an appeal to the High Court in its original jurisdiction against an objection decision.It concerned the deductibility of past years' losses.In order to be entitled to a deduction, a taxpayer had to establish certain things (for convenience, I will use the expression "continuity of beneficial ownership") to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: ITAA s 80.Dixon J stated (at 360):But it is for the commissioner, not for me, to be satisfied of the state of the voting power at the end of the year of income.His decision, it is true, is not unexaminable.If he does not address himself to the question which the sub-section formulates, if his conclusion is affected by some mistake of law, if he takes some extraneous reason into consideration or excludes from consideration some factor which should affect his determination, on any of these grounds his conclusion is liable to review.Moreover, the fact that he has not made known the reasons why he was not satisfied will not prevent the review of his decision.The conclusion he has reached may, on a full consideration of the material that was before him, be found to be capable of explanation only on the ground of some misconception.There was no reference to s 177 or s 190.Nonetheless, Dixon J may be taken to have accepted:that it was open to the taxpayer to prove the excessiveness of the assessment by showing that the Commissioner's not being satisfied as to continuity of beneficial ownership could not stand on judicial review grounds; and &#8226; that if it was established that at law the Commissioner had been bound to be satisfied, the taxpayer would be entitled to the deduction for past years' losses.Avon Downs does not address the question whether the Commissioner could be required to give particulars.It appears, however, that Dixon J contemplated that the taxpayer would have to proceed on the basis that the Commissioner was not obliged to disclose his reasons, but that the taxpayer would have available the materials that had been before the Commissioner.The role of ss 177 and 190 of the ITAA arose in George v Commissioner of Taxation [1952] HCA 21 ; (1952) 86 CLR 183 (" George ").A condition of the enlivening of the Commissioner's power to make an assessment under s 167 was, relevantly, his not being satisfied with the return furnished by a person.There were also alternative conditions, namely, default in making a return, or the Commissioner's having reason to believe that a person who had not furnished a return had derived assessable income.Mr George, however, had lodged a return.On appeal to the High Court in its original jurisdiction against the Commissioner's objection decision, the taxpayer sought an order for particulars of the sources of the additional income that the Commissioner had assessed to tax.Thus, like Avon Downs, George was a state of mind case, but the particulars sought did not relate to the Commissioner's state of mind.At first instance, Kitto J dismissed the application for particulars.His Honour's exposition of the effect of s 190 is clear and deserves to be quoted at some length.His Honour stated (at 189-190):If at the hearing the onus would be upon the commissioner to establish that the appellant did in fact derive more income in the relevant year than he had disclosed, there would be much to be said for ordering him to give particulars for the purpose of defining the precise issues for trial and preventing surprise.But s 190 places the burden of proving that the assessment is excessive upon the appellant; and in order to carry that burden he must necessarily exclude by his proof all sources of income except those which he admits.His case must be that he did not derive from any source taxable income to the amount of the assessment.That will involve him, of course, in accounting for the increase in his assets, and it may well be that the commissioner will direct his efforts mainly or even wholly to endeavouring to meet the evidence the appellant adduces on this point.But the source of the increase in the assets is not the actual issue in the case; even if it were proved, for example, that that source consisted of winning bets on the racecourse, the issue would still be whether or not from any source the appellant derived as much taxable income as the assessment treats him as having derived.The object of the present application is really to have the commissioner say whether he is prepared to assign a source or sources for the moneys included in taxable income in the assessment over and above those disclosed as taxable income in the return, and to admit that if they did not come from that source, or from one or more of those sources, those moneys were not liable to be included in the appellant's taxable income.The commissioner may, if he chooses, voluntarily narrow the possible range of evidence in that way, but there could be no justification for ordering him to do so, under the guise of ordering particulars.If he attempts to prove derivation from a particular source and fails, he is none the less entitled under the Act to point to another source, or, without troubling about source at all, to stand upon his assessment and submit that the presumption in its favour has not been displaced.Even if the commissioner at present has in mind to seek to prove that income not disclosed in the return was derived from a particular source, he cannot be pinned to that source, nor would it be proper to order him to reveal his present plan of campaign.He is entitled to say, 'I do not allege anything about source at all; I may have ideas on the subject, but if I have I shall develop or modify or abandon or replace them as occasion may require, until the evidence on the hearing is complete, and then I shall make my submissions to the Court'.His Honour then said, by reference to English authorities, that a defendant may be ordered to provide particulars where it is clear that he intends to establish his denial of the plaintiff's averment of a negative by proving a positive.His Honour said that if the Commissioner had admitted that he intended to set up a case that the additional income was derived from a particular source, he should give particulars sufficient to enable the taxpayer to meet that case.But the Commissioner had made no such admission, express or implied.In a joint judgment dismissing the taxpayer's appeal, the Full Court said (at 204):The fact is that unless the taxpayer discharges the burden laid upon him by s. 190 of proving that this ascertainment or judgment is excessive, he cannot succeed and it can be no part of the duty of the commissioner to establish affirmatively what judgment he formed, much less the grounds of it, and even less still the truth of the facts affording the grounds.Yet that is what is involved when the demand for particulars of the sources alleged of the appellant's income is justified by reference to s. 167.It is an error to treat the formation by the commissioner of a judgment as to the amount of the taxable income as if it were not the ascertainment of the taxable income which constitutes assessment or a necessary part of that process and as if it were but the fulfilment of a condition precedent to the power or authority to assess.If, however, it were a condition precedent the question would at once arise whether the fulfilment of the condition was not part of 'the due making of the assessment' of which s. 177 makes the production of a notice of assessment conclusive evidence.But of this it is unnecessary to speak specifically.At 206-207, their Honours said that s 177 distinguished between "the procedure or mechanism by which the taxable income and tax is ascertained or assessed on the one hand and on the other hand the substantive liability of the taxpayer".The former, their Honours said, involved the "due making" of the assessment, as to which production of the assessment was conclusive.They concluded (at 207):Obviously the 'due making of the assessment' was intended to cover all procedural steps, other than those [apparently, procedural steps] if any going to substantive liability and so contributing to the excessiveness of the assessment, the thing which is put in contest by an appeal.The distinction between two classes of procedural steps is a difficult one.A taxpayer is to be at liberty, by attacking procedural steps of one class, to prove in an appeal that the amount of the assessment is excessive, but may not attack other procedural steps which are left shielded by the "due making" of the assessment.As noted earlier, in his SFIC in each of the present cases, the Commissioner has stated, in accordance with a familiar formula, that he relies on s 14ZZO of the TAA, and requires the Taxpayer "to discharge its burden of proving that the assessment is excessive" (see [39] above).The Commissioner has identified the various objective conditions, the determinations made, and the amounts of the respective arm's length considerations involved ($17,897,644 in the case of WRCH, and $986,180 in the case of WRCA).He has not, however, positively asserted, or foreshadowed an intention to prove, that he had regard to any particular matters in making the determination.Why would he?His having regard to any particular matters is not made a condition of liability to tax.George is at least clear authority against the Taxpayers' right to particulars on the second ground on which the Commissioner relies.McAndrew v Commissioner of Taxation [1956] HCA 62 ; (1956) 98 CLR 263 (" McAndrew ") was also an appeal to the High Court in its original jurisdiction against an objection decision.Subsection 170 of the ITAA provided that where a taxpayer had not made to the Commissioner a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary for his assessment, and there had been an avoidance of tax, the Commissioner might amend the assessment.Where the Commissioner was of opinion that the avoidance was due to fraud or evasion, he might do so at any time, otherwise there was a six year time limit.Thus, the power to amend was conditioned upon the objective fact of the taxpayer's not having made a full and true disclosure, and on the subjective fact of the Commissioner's being of the opinion that there had been an avoidance of tax.At the parties' request, Dixon J stated a case which submitted certain questions for the opinion of a Full Court.The Full Court held, referring, inter alia , to s 190 of the ITAA, that upon production of a notice of assessment, the Commissioner did not bear the onus of establishing satisfaction of the conditions, but that the taxpayer bore the onus of establishing their non-fulfilment.In a joint judgment, Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Webb JJ referred to the distinction, recognised in George at 206, 207, between the procedure or mechanism by which taxable income and tax are assessed on the one hand, and the substantive liability to tax on the other.They said that the conditions went to substantive liability, and that it was open to the taxpayer to dispute their existence on an appeal against an assessment.If the conditions were not satisfied, the Commissioner's power to amend would not be enlivened and the amended assessment would be shown to be "excessive" (at 271).Similarly, Kitto J said (at 274-275) that the expression "due making" in s 177 covered "all procedural steps, other than those (if any) which go to substantive liability and so contributing to the excessiveness of the assessment" (his Honour also cited George at 207).His Honour added (at 275):It [the expression 'due making' is s 177] therefore covers the step of forming the opinion that an avoidance of tax is due to fraud or evasion, and the step of thinking that particular alterations or additions are necessary to correct an error in calculation or a mistake of fact or to prevent avoidance of tax.The correctness of these steps may be challenged on a reference to a board of review, for s. 177 seems clearly enough to be a provision relating only to evidence in the sense of material to be considered by judicial tribunals.Doubtless it is for that reason that the words of exception in the sub-section, which refer to proceedings on appeal, make no mention of proceedings on a reference.His Honour referred to a statement by Isaacs ACJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Clarke [1927] HCA 49 ; (1927) 40 CLR 246 at 276 that the legislation does not contemplate "a curial diving into the many official and confidential channels of information to which the commissioner may have recourse to protect the Treasury".The case was neither a state of mind class of case (as to the enlivening of the power to amend) nor a Commissioner's determination class of case.The power to amend was enlivened by the fulfilment of two objective conditions.Consistently with the joint judgment in McAndrew , the Taxpayers seek to establish non-satisfaction of the conditions that enliven of the powers to make the par  and subs  determinations.Only Kitto J in McAndrew addressed the question of the Commissioner's antecedent thought processes, and his view, as expressed above, was that by reason of s 177 they were not to be inquired into on an appeal to the court.The Taxpayers rely on Giris Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1969] HCA 5 ; (1969) 119 CLR 365 (" Giris ").Giris concerned the alternative bases of assessment of the income of trust estates provided for by ss 99 and 99A of the ITAA.Section 99A did not apply only if the Commissioner was "of the opinion that it would be unreasonable" that it should apply, in which case s 99 applied.The Commissioner assessed under s 99A.In the High Court, Menzies J referred to a Full Court the question of the constitutional validity of relevantly, s 99A.All members of the Court held that s 99A was not constitutionally invalid as imposing an incontestable tax, because the taxpayer had access to the court to challenge the Commissioner's opinion.Barwick CJ and Windeyer J indicated how this access might be availed of.The Chief Justice said that the Commissioner was under a duty to form an opinion and that the taxpayer was entitled to be informed of it, "and upon the taxpayer's request, the Commissioner should inform the taxpayer of the facts he has taken into account in reaching his conclusion" (p 373).His Honour added (at 374):Thus the Commissioner must hold the opinion.The Court can decide whether or not he did hold it.In my opinion, the Court can require him to form it.It can determine whether the opinion is held bona fide and, although as I have said, the discretion is wide and though being really legislative in nature, what is relevant to its formation may range over an extremely wide spectrum of fact and consideration, the Court can determine whether or not the opinion was formed arbitrarily or fancifully, or upon facts or considerations which could not be regarded as relevant even to such a question as the unreasonableness of applying a taxing provision to a particular taxpayer in respect of the income of a particular year.In my opinion, it cannot properly be said that there is here an unchallengeable tax as that expression is used in reasons for decisions given in this Court.Windeyer J also observed (at 384) that the Commissioner could be asked by a taxpayer to state the grounds of his opinion, and, if asked, that he should do so.Owen J approached the matter differently.His Honour seems to have accepted that the taxpayer might not be in a position to prove that the Commissioner had taken into consideration irrelevant matters (at 388-389).His Honour said that all that mattered for constitutional validity purposes, was that the taxpayer was not prevented from invoking the aid of the courts to determine whether his tax liability had been lawfully and correctly assessed.It did not matter for that purpose that it might be "difficult or impossible to exercise the right of appeal successfully because the facts necessary to success [could not] be established" (at 388).Neither Kitto J at first instance nor the members of the Full Court referred to the relationship between ss 177 and 190 of the ITAA.Giris was another state of mind case.Moreover, examinability of the Commissioner's opinion was, in substance, all that stood between a contestable tax and an incontestable one.On the assumption that there was no challenge to the Commissioner's assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income, the only question going to the excessiveness of his assessment of tax was his opinion that it was not unreasonable that the special rate of tax imposed pursuant to s 99A should apply.In Duggan &amp; Anor v Commissioner of Taxation [1972] HCA 66 ; (1972) 129 CLR 365 (" Duggan "), an appeal to the High Court against objection decisions, Stephen J set aside assessments under s 99A.The Commissioner had informed the taxpayer of the three grounds on which he had relied in thinking it not unreasonable for s 99A to apply.Stephen J held that while the grounds stated relevant considerations, they involved errors of fact, with the result that the Commissioner's opinion ceased to be of any legal effect.His Honour added (at 370): "[i]t is as if he has failed to reach any opinion or has reached it upon the basis of irrelevant facts".Duggan is distinguishable from the present case on two grounds: first, it was a state of mind case, whereas the present case is a Commissioner's determination case; secondly, the Commissioner had positively stated the matters he had taken into account in arriving at his state of mind.Like Avon Downs , Commissioner of Taxation v Brian Hatch Timber Co (Sales) Pty Ltd [1971] HCA 18 ; (1972) 128 CLR 28 (" Brian Hatch ") concerned the carry forward loss provisions.A necessary condition of deductibility under s 80A of the ITAA was the taxpayer company's satisfying the Commissioner concerning continuity of beneficial ownership --- a state of mind case.At first instance, Walsh J upheld the taxpayer's appeal, applying the passage from Dixon J's judgment in Avon Downs .The only material before the Commissioner that was before his Honour was the taxpayer's return and a record of interview.In substance, Walsh J held that on this slim material, the Commissioner had not been entitled not to be satisfied of continuity of beneficial ownership.In allowing an appeal, all members of the Full Court also referred to Dixon J in Avon Downs , but considered that the taxpayer had not established any of the grounds to which Dixon J had referred.In other words, so far as the evidence led by the taxpayer showed, the Commissioner had been entitled not to be satisfied.Barwick CJ said (at 45) that the primary Judge had rightly regarded the Commissioner's lack of satisfaction as examinable on Avon Downs grounds, noting that the taxpayer had not taken the course of seeking from the Commissioner "an account of the material upon which he acted in rejecting the claim to the deduction" (at 45).The Chief Justice added that it was unsatisfactory that the Commissioner had not led evidence of any matter that he had before him.It is implicit, I think, that Barwick CJ thought that the taxpayer would have been entitled to particulars of the material that was before the Commissioner, and, perhaps, of the matters he had taken into account.Menzies J likewise thought it "unfortunate that the basis of the Commissioner's not being satisfied of what was requisite for allowing the deduction claimed was not revealed" (at 52).His Honour noted that the taxpayer might properly have inquired of the Commissioner why he was not satisfied, and observed that "[s]uch an inquiry would no doubt have been answered" (ibid).Windeyer J pointed out (at 56) that the question was not whether a discretion was properly exercised, but whether a fact existed: did the taxpayer in fact satisfy the Commissioner of beneficial ownership as prescribed by s 80A?Owen J (with whom Windeyer J agreed) noted that the taxpayer had not taken various courses that had been open to it, one of which was to inquire of the Commissioner what matters he had considered in disallowing the deduction claimed, or why he had not been satisfied about the state of the shareholding at the relevant times (at 59-60).Again, it seems clear that in their Honours' view, the Commissioner would have been compellable to answer such inquiries.In Brian Hatch , there are fairly clear obiter dicta that upon request, the taxpayer would have been entitled to compel the Commissioner to expose his reasons for his state of mind and to identify all the material that was before him when he disallowed the objection.Again, however, there was no reference to s 177 or s 190 of the ITAA.In Master Butchers , the Commissioner contended that s 260 of the ITAA applied.The taxpayer requested that its objection be treated as an appeal to the Supreme Court of New South Wales pursuant to s 187 of that Act.The taxpayer requested particulars of the way in which the Commissioner contended s 260 applied, including particulars of the contract, agreement or arrangement relied on.The Commissioner, referring to s 190, replied to the effect that he reserved the right, at the conclusion of the evidence to advance such arguments based on s 260 as seemed appropriate.Mahoney J held that the Court had inherent power to order further and better particulars where the requirements of justice so dictated, and cited Isaacs J in Northern Collieries at 740 (see [38] above).While his Honour accepted that in an appropriate case, the Court had power to order the Commissioner to provide further and better particulars "of a matter in issue in the proceeding" (at 356), he did not order the Commissioner to provide any of the particulars sought.For his Honour, the test to be applied was whether it appeared to the court, upon the material before it, that there was "a real and a substantial danger that the party seeking the particulars [would] be prejudiced by not knowing the nature of the case to the [sic --- be] made out against him" (at 357).His Honour said that in a proper case, such a party may be entitled to an order that the other party furnish particulars of "the general nature and of the constituent facts, of the case to be relied upon or to some other order appropriate in the circumstances" (ibid).Kolotex Hosiery (Australia) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 5 ; (1975) 132 CLR 535 (" Kolotex ") was another case concerning the carry forward loss provisions.On the taxpayer's appeal to the High Court against the Commissioner's disallowance of its objection, the Commissioner's file was in evidence before the primary Judge, Mason J, who held that the Commissioner had been entitled to be "not satisfied" of continuity of beneficial ownership.The Full Court affirmed his Honour's decision.The majority, Gibbs J and Stephen J, in separate judgments, thought that, although the course of reasoning the Commissioner had followed in reaching the conclusion that he was not satisfied involved errors of law, it was not open to the Court to regard the Commissioner as having had the required state of satisfaction that there was continuity of beneficial ownership.Indeed, their Honours thought that, for other reasons, on the law and the facts he could not properly have been satisfied that there was.On that basis, his state of non-satisfaction and the assessment must stand, and the appeal be dismissed.Barwick CJ dissented.His Honour said (at 541) that the Commissioner should have recorded "his relevant state of mind and the facts or his view of the facts on which it is based", and that it should not be left to the Court to draw inferences as to whether he had considered a matter.The Chief Justice added, citing his own judgment in Giris , that the Commissioner "must expose to the taxpayer, particularly if so requested , both his state of mind at the relevant time and its basis" (at 541) (emphasis added).Like the majority and Windeyer J in Brian Hatch , his Honour saw the issue as being one of fact: was the Commissioner in fact satisfied at the point of assessment or not?His Honour disagreed with the majority, however, as to the Commissioner's right to support his state of dissatisfaction at the time by a course of reasoning devised later.The Chief Justice also said (at 543) that the Commissioner's purported state of dissatisfaction would be negated if the taxpayer could prove the existence of relevant facts which ought to have satisfied him.His Honour thought it unacceptable that by not fully investigating or by being in ignorance of relevant facts, the Commissioner might be regarded as having been properly dissatisfied on such material as happened to be in his possession.All Judges accepted that the Commissioner's state of non-satisfaction was reviewable on Avon Downs grounds.However, none of the judgments referred to the interaction between ss 177 or s 190 of the ITAA.The operation of s 190 of the ITAA was explained by Mason J (dissenting) in Gauci v Commissioner of Taxation [1975] HCA 54 ; (1975) 135 CLR 81 at 89 as follows:Section 190 of the Act imposed on the appellants the burden of proving that the assessments were excessive.The appellants relied on their evidence and that of Graham [their land agent who acted for them] in order to show that the assessments were excessive.Once that evidence was rejected, the appellants' case necessarily failed.The Act does not place any onus on the Commissioner to show that the assessments were correctly made.Nor is there any statutory requirement that the assessments should be sustained or supported by evidence.The implication of such a requirement would be inconsistent with s. 190 for it is a consequence of that provision that unless the appellant shows by evidence that the assessment is incorrect, it will prevail.The view expressed by Mason J in this passage has been endorsed: see McCormack v Commissioner of Taxation [1979] HCA 18 ; (1979) 143 CLR 284, esp at 302-304 (Gibbs J), 306 (Stephen J), 323 (Murphy J); Macmine Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1979) 53 ALJR 362, esp at 371 (Stephen J), 381 (Murphy J); Commissioner of Taxation v Dalco [1990] HCA 3 ; (1990) 168 CLR 614 esp at 624-5 (Brennan J with whom Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh agreed, and Deane J generally agreed) (" Dalco ").Practice Note No 22, referred to at [37], is consistent with it.A question of the Commissioner's liability to supply particulars arose in Bailey .The Commissioner had relied on the then general anti-avoidance rule in s 260 of the ITAA.The Court ordered him to provide particulars of the arrangement he alleged was rendered void against him by s 260.Aickin J delivered the leading judgment (Barwick CJ, and Gibbs, Mason and Jacobs JJ expressed agreement with his Honour's reasons).His Honour said that the particulars sought were necessary so that the case would "proceed in an orderly and comprehensible manner" (at 227).His Honour thought that it was not in the interests of the proper administration of justice that on the hearing the appellant should have to "speculate about, and adduce evidence to negate, every possible kind of agreement or arrangement and avoidance which the imagination of his advisers can conjure up" (ibid).It did not matter that s 260 was "self-executing" and did not depend on the Commissioner's forming an opinion or reaching a state of satisfaction.With his Honour's approach may be contrasted that of Kitto J in George (see [47] above).Barwick CJ referred to s 190.His Honour stated that if some step in the process of assessment lacked "the authority of the Act", the assessment would be shown to be excessive.His Honour continued (at 217):I have elsewhere indicated, and now confirm, that, in my opinion, it is that process which must be exposed to the Court and with which the Court is exclusively concerned in an appeal by the taxpayer.The Chief Justice stated (ibid): "Quite clearly, the taxpayer is entitled to know the basis on which the assessment has been made".In this case, again, Barwick CJ expressed himself in favour of disclosure and particularisation by the Commissioner.However, apparently his Honour contemplated only a brief particularisation of the assessment by the Commissioner.He said (at 218) that "a statement by the Commissioner in his adjustment sheet of the assessable income as determined by him would be a sufficient compliance with ... [his] obligation in informing the taxpayer of the basis of the assessment".A little confusingly at times, the judgments in Bailey contain references to both particulars of the assessment, and particulars of the Commissioner's case to be raised on the hearing.The adjustment sheet which accompanied the notice of assessment showed that the Commissioner had included the taxpayer's proportion ($77,235) of a distribution of $411,920 by Bailey Holdings Pty Ltd.In the course of correspondence, the Commissioner informed the taxpayer that he was relying on s 260 in including that amount.The particulars ordered to be provided were further particulars of the distribution and particulars of the arrangement said to be within s 260.Thus, the order was for further particulars of matters that the Commissioner had already positively asserted as having formed part of his assessment.There is no suggestion that the Commissioner would not have been permitted to identify the arrangement concerned in alternative ways, or to amend later the particulars given of the arrangement, subject to any special order as to costs.Bailey was neither a state of mind nor a Commissioner's determination class of case.I understand Bailey , like Master Butchers , as a case concerned with the practical running of a trial.It does not determine the question whether the Commissioner should be ordered to provide particulars, not of positive assertions made by him, but of his thought processes antecedent to a positive statutorily required step that he does assert --- the making of a determination.The judgments in Bailey do not refer to s 177, and make only passing reference to s 190.FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 27 ; (1981) 147 CLR 360 (" FJ Bloemen ") comprised two appeals, heard together, from decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal: FJ Bloemen Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (unreported) and Dorney v Commissioner of Taxation and Simons v Commissioner of Taxation [1980] 1 NSWLR 404 (" Dorney and Simons ").The appeal against the Commissioner's objection decision in the FJ Bloemen proceeding was heard by Rath J: (1978) 36 FLR 191.However, by reason of the judgments which that Court had in meanwhile delivered in the Dorney and Simons appeals, the Court of Appeal dismissed the FJ Bloemen appeal.Thus, the reasons of the Court of Appeal are to be found in the Dorney and Simons appeals.Taxpayers sought declarations that certain notices of assessment were void in that there had been no valid assessments.The taxpayers filed points of claim and, the Commissioner, points of defence.Certain questions raised by the points of defence were ordered to be separately determined and were referred to the Court of Appeal.The question that was pursued in that Court was whether the facts alleged by the taxpayers entitled them to the declaratory relief claimed.Hutley and Glass JJA answered the separate questions, in so far as they related to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to grant the declaratory relief sought, but Mahoney JA, dissenting, held (at 414) that the questions were not appropriate to be answered.Both Hutley JA and Mahoney JA made certain observations relevant to the scope of an appeal, then under Pt V of the ITAA, against an objection decision.Hutley JA said (at 411), referring to Duggan and George , that an appeal under Pt V was of "the most comprehensive kind", so that, for example, it could be shown on such an appeal that a belief by the Commissioner as to the existence of certain facts was unsound.Mahoney JA stated (at 423):Ordinarily, whether an assessment was 'duly made' would be affected by, eg, whether the Commissioner took into account irrelevant matters, or failed to take into account relevant matters, in the exercise of a discretion affecting a component of the taxable income.But this is a matter which obviously is open for consideration on an appeal under Pt V; and the production of the notice of assessment cannot, as conclusive evidence that the assessment was 'duly made', prevent the taxpayer raising such a matter.Therefore, the suggestion was, the operation of s 177 must be read down.Were the matter free from authority, this argument would, in my opinion, carry substantial force.But, as Mr Simos [senior counsel for the Commissioner] properly pointed out, the course of decision has been so to construe s 177 that such matters fall, not within 'the due making of the assessment' in the first part of the section, but within 'the amount and all the particulars of the assessment' in the second part of it.On that basis, the production of the notice of assessment is not conclusive on appeal against it: George [at 206, 207] ; McAndrew [at 270, 271, 274, 275, 281, 282].His Honour seems to have accepted the general proposition that in an appeal , any exercise of discretion by the Commissioner affecting a component of the taxable income is open to attack on judicial review grounds.The question raised on the appeal to the High Court in FJ Bloemen was stated by Mason and Wilson JJ in their Honours' joint judgment to be whether the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in a statutory appeal under the ITAA or in a proceeding for declaratory relief, has jurisdiction to determine that an assessment of the taxpayer to income tax under s 166 of the ITAA is invalid, notwithstanding that a notice of assessment is produced by the Commissioner, and that the notice has the force of conclusive evidence (except in proceedings on appeal against the assessment) under s 177.Their Honours noted (at 365) that the case presented by the taxpayers had been that the Commissioner did not in truth make final assessments, but purported to make assessments which, if made at all, were only tentative or provisional, in neither case being authorised by the ITAA.In the FJ Bloemen case, the taxpayer also contended that the Commissioner had not made his assessments from the return or from any other information in his possession, in accordance with s 166, and that his real purpose was not to assess the amount of taxable income or of the tax payable thereon, but to cause a debt for tax to come into existence so that he could exercise his powers under s 218 of the ITAA (at 365-366).In the High Court, the taxpayers argued that s 177 was enlivened only where something amounting to an "assessment" had been made, and that production of a notice of assessment did not preclude inquiry into whether that condition was satisfied.However, the Court unanimously rejected the submission.Mason and Wilson JJ, with whom Stephen J agreed, said that upon production of a notice of assessment that was final and definitive on its face, as distinct from provisional or tentative, the notice was conclusive evidence that an assessment was actually made, not merely conclusive evidence that an assessment, if made, was duly made (at 378).The High Court judgments in FJ Bloemen do not assist greatly in the present appeals.Part IVA was introduced into the ITAA by Act No 110 of 1981, replacing s 260 as the ITAA's general anti-avoidance rule.Div 13's more specific anti-avoidance provision was introduced the following year as complementary to Pt IVA (see [13] above).Part IVA and Div 13 are similarly structured.Unlike the former s 260, they both provide for the making of determinations by the Commissioner as conditions of liability to tax.None of the cases considered above were of such a Commissioner's determination class of case.In Jackson v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 87 ALR 461 (" Jackson "), the Commissioner made a determination pursuant to s 177F that the amounts of certain tax benefits should be included in the taxpayer's assessable incomes for two years.The taxpayer served on the Commissioner a notice to produce.Gummow J set aside certain questions for separate decision.The first question was whether, on the hearing of an appeal against the disallowance of an objection against an assessment made consequent upon the making of a determination under s 177F, it is necessary or relevant for the court to inquire into the matters taken into account by the Commissioner, or his reasoning process, when he formed the view that a tax benefit had been obtained, or would have been obtained, but for the operation of s 177F, by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme to which Pt IVA applied.His Honour answered this first question "No".This holding is instructive but not presently relevant.The obtaining of a tax benefit was one condition precedent to the arising of the Commissioner's power to make a determination under s 177F.Whether that condition was satisfied was to be decided by the application of objective criteria.The condition was thus akin to the present objective condition that the taxpayer supplied property under an international agreement, or that the amount of the consideration received or receivable by the taxpayer was less than the arm's length consideration.While, no doubt, the Commissioner did think that that condition was satisfied, his opinion that it was not made an element of the liability to tax, and his reasons for being of that opinion were therefore irrelevant.Defective reasoning on his part would not advance the taxpayer's case if the condition was in fact satisfied.The second separate question was related to the Commissioner's determination pursuant to s 177F, but not to the provision of particulars.The question was whether, in an appeal, documents are discoverable by the Commissioner or liable to be the subject of a subpoena or notice to produce addressed to the Commissioner, by reason only that the documents record or comprise, in substance, the submissions and internal memoranda prepared by the Commissioner's officers for consideration by the officer who made the determination under s 177F, and any decision or reasons for decision recorded by that officer, or the facts, matters or circumstances referred to in such submissions and memoranda.Gummow J answered this second question "Yes" because like the Taxpayers in the present case, the taxpayer was attempting to show that the Commissioner's determinations were not authorised by the ITAA.His Honour observed:at 469-470) that s 177F fell into "that category where an opinion formed by the Commissioner or a determination by him or his state of mind, is made a crucial element in the process of assessment", citing Bailey at 225 (Aickin J);at 470) that the assessment would be "excessive" if some step in the Commissioner's process of ascertainment of the amount of tax lacked the authority of the ITAA, citing Bailey at 217 (Barwick CJ); andat 470) that a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F would lack the authority of the ITAA if, inter alia , the Commissioner had regard to irrelevant considerations or omitted to have regard to relevant ones, citing Avon Downs at 360 (Dixon J).It will be noted that Gummow J did not distinguish between state of mind cases and Commissioner's determination cases: both belonged to the same "category" (at 469).Consistently, his Honour considered that a determination would lack the authority of the ITAA, just as a state of mind would do, if defective on judicial review grounds.Gummow J's answer to the second question does not resolve the present question of the Taxpayers' entitlement to particulars.It does, however, suggest that those particulars are not to be refused on the broad ground relied on by the Commissioner that s 177 of the ITAA prevents the Taxpayers from attacking the Commissioner's par  and subs  determinations on judicial review grounds.While his Honour did not refer to s 177 of the ITAA, he did refer to s 190, and must have regarded a determination not authorised by the ITAA, whether because it failed to satisfy statutorily prescribed conditions or because of judicial review grounds, as lying outside s 177.An appeal from his Honour's judgment, in so far as it answered a further separate question not presently relevant, was dismissed: Commissioner of Taxation v Jackson (1989) 27 FCR 1.The taxpayer was held entitled to particulars in Western Australian Capital Investment Co Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 87 ALR 183 (" WA Capital ").The Commissioner had issued notices under the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982  ("the TUCTA Act ").Subsection s 18 of the TUCTA Act governed the giving of such a notice.The relevant condition which enlivened the Commissioner's power to give a notice was that the Commissioner was of the opinion that vendor's recoupment tax was likely to become payable by a person or persons in relation to ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax, as the case may be.The taxpayer asserted, and the Commissioner denied, that the Commissioner did not, prior to the issue of the notice, address his mind to this matter.The taxpayer said that the inference that he did not do so was to be drawn from the Commissioner's letter that accompanied the notice, which did not refer to the Commissioner's being of the opinion that vendor's recoupment tax was likely to become payable.The case can be classified as a state of mind case, albeit one in which the legislation did not operate to create a liability immediately upon the existence of the specified state of mind.Rather the existence of the state of mind was expressed as the condition which enlivened the Commissioner's power to give the notice.The taxpayer sought particulars as to the making of the opinion, such as who made it, what facts he or she took into account, whether the facts of opinion were recorded in writing, and the authority of the person who formed the opinion.The Commissioner submitted that particulars should not be ordered unless it appeared that he proposed to advance a positive case (at 189).He maintained that he was entitled to resist passively the taxpayer's attack on the opinion issue, in relation to which he did not intend to call evidence.He contended that the taxpayer bore the onus of showing either that the opinion had not been held, or that, although held, it was legally insupportable.This is in accordance with the alternative submission made by the Commissioner in the present case, the Commissioner's primary submission here being that, by reason of ss 175 and 177 of the ITAA, it is not open to the Taxpayers to attempt to prove that the making of the determinations was legally insupportable.Pursuant to directions, the issues before the primary Judge were defined by the taxpayer's delivering points of claim and the Commissioner's delivering a response.The taxpayer asserted, and the Commissioner denied, that prior to the issue of the assessment, the Commissioner did not address his mind to the matter mentioned.The primary Judge held that, in the absence of an affirmative statement by the Commissioner, the taxpayer was not entitled to particulars.However, the Full Court (Pincus, Gummow, Lee JJ) disagreed.Their Honours thought that Bailey , which they described as "the leading case on this subject", was "inconsistent with the general proposition that if the Commissioner intimates that he will not call any evidence about a matter necessary to the validity of his assessment, but will simply argue at the trial that the taxpayer had not displaced the assessment, particulars of its basis would ordinarily not be ordered" (at 191).They said: "[n]o trace of such a doctrine can be found in the reasons [in Bailey ]".Their Honours conceded, as the primary Judge had implied, that if the particulars sought were ordered, that might enable the taxpayer to win an otherwise unwinnable case.However, they thought that particulars should have been ordered, having regard to the fact that the holding of the opinion was itself made a condition of the validity of the assessment and that the covering letter had made further examination of that opinion a legitimate subject of inquiry.The case can be distinguished from the present one on the ground that the ITAA does not make the Commissioner's state of mind on any matter a condition of the power to make either the par  determinations or the subs  determination, and, therefore, a condition of liability to tax.Whether that is a satisfactory ground of distinction is another matter (see [155] below).The effect of ss 175 and 177 of the ITAA was considered by the High Court in Dalco .The Commissioner had assessed under ss 166 and 167 as in George .A majority in a Full Court of this Court had held that the taxpayer had shown that each assessment was excessive "in that it was not warranted by law" ( Dalco v Commissioner of Taxation 88 (1988) ATC 4649 at 4666).Accordingly, this Court had remitted each matter to the Commissioner for reassessment.The High Court reversed this Court's decision.Mason CJ, Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ agreed with Brennan J and Toohey J. Brennan J said (at 621) that a taxpayer's burden of proving that an assessment is excessive is not necessarily discharged by showing an error by the Commissioner in forming a judgment as to the amount of the assessment.His Honour distinguished McAndrew as a case in which it was denied that the Commissioner had the power to make an amended assessment, for non-fulfilment of a condition precedent to the arising of that power.His Honour said (at 623): "[t]he amount of the assessment might not be excessive in fact, though the reasons which led to the assessment were erroneous".Brennan J and Toohey J (ibid) referred to George , in which the High Court stated that the burden lay on the taxpayer of "establishing affirmatively that the amount of taxable income for which he has been assessed exceeds the actual taxable income which he has derived during the year of income" ( George at 201).I see the cases under ss 166 and 167 as distinguishable from cases under Pt IVA and Div 13 in one respect.In cases under Pt IVA and Div 13, the making of determinations by the Commissioner is a necessary element in the assessment.All other things being equal, if the taxpayer is permitted to establish and does establish that the determinations were not authorised by the ITAA, the real world will be left in place, the ITAA will work on it to establish the amount of the taxpayer's liability, and that amount will be less than the amount assessed.Under ss 166 and 167, however, in order to prove excessiveness, the taxpayer must prove affirmatively the correct amount of taxable income and of tax.If the taxpayer fails to do so, the possibility will always remain that the Commissioner's assessment is not excessive.The distinction between state of mind cases and Commissioner's determination cases was referred to by the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 (" Peabody "), a Part IVA case.In a joint judgment, all seven members of the High Court stated (at 382):Under s. 177F, the Commissioner's discretion to cancel a tax benefit extends only to a tax benefit obtained in connexion with a scheme to which Pt IVA applies.The existence of the discretion is not made to depend upon the Commissioner's opinion or satisfaction that there is a tax benefit or that, if there is a tax benefit, it is obtained in connexion with a Pt IVA scheme.Those are posited as objective facts [citing McAndrew at 276-277 (Kitto J), and referring to Avon Downs at 360 (Dixon J)] .The erroneous identification by the Commissioner of a scheme as being one to which Pt IVA applies or a misconception on his part as to the connexion of a tax benefit with such a scheme will result in the wrongful exercise of the discretion conferred by s. 177F only if in the event the tax benefit which the Commissioner purports to cancel is not a tax benefit within the meaning of Pt IVA.That is unlikely to be the case if the error goes to the mere detail of a scheme relied upon by the Commissioner.An error of a more fundamental kind, however, may have that result --- where, for example, it leads to the identification of the wrong taxpayer as the recipient of the tax benefit.But the question in every case must be whether a tax benefit which the Commissioner has purported to cancel is in fact a tax benefit obtained in connexion with a Pt IV A scheme and so susceptible to cancellation at the discretion of the Commissioner" (emphasis added).The "erroneous identification" and "misconception" to which their Honours referred might be compared to an erroneous identification by the Commissioner of the international agreement in question in the present case.The error may or may not vitiate the Commissioner's exercise of his discretion determining that subss 136AD or  (as the case may be) is to apply in relation to the Taxpayers in relation to the supply of property.Following the passage noted above, their Honours continued by noting that the Commissioner may be required to supply particulars of the scheme relied on (they cited Bailey ), but was entitled to put his case in alternative ways (I suggest by identifying different schemes in the alternative), provided no undue embarrassment or surprise was caused to the taxpayer.Even after a scheme had been particularised, they noted (at 382-383), the position might be cured by amendment, provided the interests of justice allowed such a course (citing Bailey at 219).Their Honours did not refer to the question of defects in the process of the making of the discretionary determination under s 177F (except in the one respect mentioned in the passage quoted above).In Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 23 ; (1995) 183 CLR 168 (" Richard Walter "), in substance the Commissioner made two determinations under s 177F on the same day in respect of the same tax benefit: one that the amount be included in the assessable income of Richard Walter Pty Ltd ("the taxpayer"); and the other that it be included in the assessable income of Morlea Professional Services Pty Ltd ("Morlea").The taxpayer appealed to this Court against the disallowance of its objection.The Deputy Commissioner sued to recover the unpaid tax in the Supreme Court of New South Wales.The taxpayer sought in this Court an injunction under s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903  ("the Judiciary Act ") restraining him from proceeding with that action.In the s 39B proceeding, the Deputy Commissioner moved for dismissal on the ground that upon production of the notice of the assessment, s 177 of the ITAA had the effect that this Court lacked jurisdiction to grant relief under s 39B.The Commissioner's motion was removed to the High Court.In the High Court, upon a stated case, there was reserved for consideration by the Full Court the question raised by the motion.Six independent judgments were delivered.Little was said that specifically related to the interaction between s 177 of the ITAA and s 14ZZO of the TAA: the focus of attention was on the production of a notice of assessment in a proceeding to recover tax, and on a responsive application for relief under s 39B of the Judiciary Act .Several references were made to the principle enunciated by Dixon J in R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598 at 615, where, as is well known, his Honour said that a privative clause (cf s 177) is given effect despite non-compliance with provisions governing the exercise of a power, provided always that the purported exercise  is a bona fide attempt to exercise the power,  relates to the subject matter of the legislation, and  is reasonably capable of being regarded as referable to the power ("the Hickman principle").It was held (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ) that s 177 of the ITAA does not purport to deprive this Court of the jurisdiction conferred on it by s 39B of the Judiciary Act; (Deane and Gaudron JJ) that s 39B overrides or amends s 177 to the extent that s 177 would make a notice of assessment conclusive evidence of the due making of an assessment in a proceeding under s 39B in which the applicant's case is that an assessment is invalid on the ground that it was not made bona fide; (Brennan J) that in proceedings other than reviews or appeals under Pt IVC of the TAA, ss 175 and 177 operate congruently and are to be given effect consistently with the Hickman principle.Brennan J said that in proceedings under Pt IVC, however, s 177 presents no obstacle to giving full effect to the general provisions of the ITAA governing the assessment of the taxpayer's taxable income and tax liability (at 198).Mason CJ observed (at 178) that the making of a determination under s 177F "forms part of the process of assessment and goes to the ascertainment of the substantive liability of the taxpayer to tax " (emphasis in original).His Honour referred to the distinction recognised in George , McAndrew , FJ Bloemen and Dalco , between the procedural mechanism by which taxable income is ascertained on the one hand, and the taxpayer's substantive liability on the other, the former (alone) involving the "due making" of the assessment (at 182-184).After referring to certain illustrations of the distinction, the Chief Justice observed (at 184):the making of a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F of the [ITAA] is a determination going to substantive liability and, in conformity with the interpretation of s 177 adopted in George , McAndrew , FJ Bloemen and Dalco , is put in issue by an appeal which challenges the assessment on the ground that it is excessive.Later, Mason CJ referred specifically to the susceptibility of a determination under s 177F to attack in an appeal to this Court against an objection decision.His Honour stated (at 187-8):In such an appeal, it is for the taxpayer to show that the assessment is excessive.In that context, the existence of an inadmissible purpose on the part of the Commissioner plays no part.The central element of the legislative r&eacute;gime is the making of an assessment by the Commissioner which ascertains the taxpayer's liability to tax and the reference to the Tribunal or the appeal to the Federal Court, in which the taxpayer is entitled to dispute his or her substantive liability to tax.In such an appeal, the taxpayer is at liberty to challenge the exercise of any relevant discretion by the Commissioner.Thus, on appeal, the court will set aside the assessment if any relevant exercise of discretion by the Commissioner is affected by error of law, if he has taken an extraneous factor into account or if he has failed to consider a material factor [citing Avon Downs at 360]" (emphasis added).Unguided by later authority, one might be excused for thinking that the effect of both passages from the judgment of Mason CJ is that it is open to a taxpayer on an appeal to this Court under Pt IVC of the TAA to challenge a determination under s 177F, and, I suggest it would follow, under s 136AD, on judicial review grounds.The reason is that the taxable income and tax are as high as they are only because the discretion to make a determination was exercised, and it is open to the taxpayer to show the excessiveness of the assessment by bringing down the determination.As will be seen, however, in the case to be discussed next, both the primary Judge and a Full Court of this Court understood Mason CJ differently.In Binetter v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 687 ; (2003) 130 FCR 135, Hill J ordered the Commissioner to provide particulars.The Commissioner had made a determination under s 177F of the ITAA.The proceeding was an appeal to this Court against the Commissioner's disallowance of the taxpayer's objection.His Honour noted that it was not in dispute that the Court had power to order particulars where they were "necessary for the orderly disposition of the appeal" or to order discovery "where as a matter of discretion the court is of the view that it is appropriate that discovery be given" (at 137).His Honour ordered that the Commissioner:identify which of the determinations (under s 177F) referred to in the Commissioner's SOFIC the Commissioner proposed to rely upon at the hearing;identify which, if any, of the determinations the Commissioner proposed to rely upon in the alternative;make available for inspection by the taxpayer documents that were before the person who made the determination or determinations, at the time or times of the making of it or them;identify the steps comprising any scheme within the meaning of s 177A of the ITAA on which the Commissioner proposed to rely, indicating if any scheme was to be relied on in the alternative;advise the applicant whether the Commissioner alleged that the Commissioner made a determination or determinations under s 177F (for a "compensating adjustment"), and, if so, advise the name of the officer who made the determination, the date it was made and the terms of it;produce for inspection the documents that were before the officer who made any determination which the Commissioner alleges was made, at the time it was made.There is nothing in these orders that suggests that a taxpayer is entitled to particulars going to judicial review grounds as are sought in the present case, or is entitled to attack the making of a determination under s 177F on judicial review grounds.The Commissioner's discretionary power to make a determination under s 177F is conditioned on the obtaining of a tax benefit by a taxpayer in connection with a scheme to which Pt IVA applies --- objective criteria.His Honour thought it to be in the interests of justice that the Commissioner be required to specify the determination or determinations, and the scheme or schemes, on which he would rely on the hearing.His Honour recognised the possibility that the Commissioner might put his case in alternative ways and might seek to depart from the particulars supplied (if he were to take the latter course, the matter would have to be addressed if and when the occasion arose).Of some relevance to the present case is the following statement made by his Honour (at 138-139):A taxpayer may seek to challenge the making of such a determination on the basis that it is not authorised by the Act.Indeed, the objection to the present assessment includes such a ground.In such a case the court has a discretion to order that there be produced to the court, and subject to matters of privilege, to the taxpayer, the material which was before the decision-maker who made the determination at the time the decision maker did so.The court's power to make such an order was recognised by Gummow J when a Judge of this court and is discussed by his Honour in Jackson v Commissioner of Taxation  (1989) 20 ATR 611 at 621.I am of the view in the present case that discovery of such documents should be given and the applicant be permitted inspection of them but that discovery and inspection be limited to the material that was before the decision-maker.Hill J's reference to a determination's not being "authorised by the Act" is capable of being read as a reference to the non-satisfaction of the statutorily prescribed conditions of the power to make a determination under s 177F, or as a reference to judicial review grounds (or as both).The question is not resolved by the reference to the particular passage cited in Gummow J's judgment in Jackson that his Honour cited.In view of his Honour's judgment in the next case to be discussed, however, I would not understand him to have intended to include a reference to judicial review grounds.In Commissioner of Taxation v Sleight [2004] FCAFC 94 ; (2004) 136 FCR 211, the taxpayer ("Mr Sleight") appealed to the Court against an adverse objection decision.He contended that a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F was invalid because the Commissioner's discretion had miscarried because there had been a failure to consider certain circumstances personal to Mr Sleight.The primary Judge, RD Nicholson, held ( Sleight v Commissioner of Taxation (2003) 53 ATR 667 at ) that the making of a s 177F determination was "part of the process of making the assessment ... and not liable to challenge in this proceeding save in respect of matters going to substantive liability: Richard Walter at CLR 178, 203".His Honour held that it followed that any deficiency was validated by s 175.For this last proposition, his Honour referred to Richard Walter at 182, 187-8, 193-5, 196-7, 198-9, 209-211, 222-3 and 240-2.Finally, his Honour noted that no argument had been made that the case fell within "the conditions delineated in R v Hickman ".A Full Court of this Court allowed the taxpayer's appeal, but on the present issue agreed with the conclusion of the primary Judge.Hill J, whose eminence in this field is beyond question, delivered the leading judgment.His Honour held that a taxpayer cannot challenge a determination under s 177F on the ground that the Commissioner had erred in the making of the determination, for example, by failing to take into account a relevant consideration.His Honour was clear in his view that ss 175 and 177 produced this result.He referred to George at 207 (see [49] above) and Richard Walter at 184 (Mason CJ) (see [128] above).Of the latter passage, Hill J stated (at 237):In other words, it is not open to a taxpayer to challenge an assessment under Pt IVA by showing some error in the making of that determination.His Honour found support in the fact that in Richard Walter their Honours held that the question in every case was whether there was a tax benefit obtained in connection with a Pt IVA scheme susceptible to cancellation by the Commissioner.Hill J added (at 238):The question whether the Commissioner's discretion [sic --- decision] as to whether there was a scheme to which Part IVA applied miscarried is thus not an issue in an appeal.Rather the issue will be, relevant to the present appeal, whether, the determination having been made, there was a scheme to which the provisions of Part IVA applied and if so, whether there was a tax benefit obtained in connection with that scheme.These will be matters of fact and the burden will lie on the taxpayer to show that objectively there was no scheme in connection with which the taxpayer obtained a tax benefit.If the taxpayer satisfies that burden he or she will have shown the assessment was excessive.That will not be shown by the taxpayer demonstrating that the person who made the determination in some way erred in making it so that the discretion conferred upon the Commissioner miscarried.Carr J (at [242]) and Hely J (at [247]) agreed with Hill J on the present issue.While Sleight related to a determination under s 177F, and the present case relates to determinations under s 136AD, there is no material difference in the statutory architecture that would render the Full Court's decision in Sleight inapplicable to the circumstances of the present case.Even if Sleight is not strictly binding on me, I think I should follow the approach that was taken by the primary Judge and all three Judges in the Full Court.With respect, however, their Honours appear to have found the result to be more clearly dictated by the authorities, and, in particular, by Richard Walter , than I have found it to be.It is not clear to me why the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ in Richard Walter at 184 (set out in [128] above) establishes that in an appeal it is not open to the taxpayer to challenge the making of a determination on judicial review grounds.Moreover, there is no reference to the passage from the judgment of Mason CJ at 187-8 (also set out at [128] above) (the primary Judge, RD Nicholson J, did refer to that passage, but did not discuss it).There is no reference, either, to Gummow J's answer to the second separate question in Jackson (see [104]---[106] above) or, admittedly less relevantly, to WA Capital (see [107]---[114] above).Hill J also said (at 237) that Richard Walter was consistent with what the High Court said in Peabody at 382 (the passage set out at [119] above).I respectfully agree that that passage in Peabody does favour the view that the only basis on which a determination by the Commissioner under s 177F (and, it would follow, determinations by him under s 136AD) could be challenged, even in an appeal, is the non-fulfilment of the statutorily specified conditions precedent to the enlivening of the discretion (and, I suggest, the Hickman principle).In both ss 177F and 136AD, the ITAA specifies a number of conditions, and provides that if they are met, the Commissioner may make a determination, the effect of which is that the taxpayer's taxable income will be greater than it would otherwise have been.With one exception, all of the conditions are "objective" (the exception is the condition in s 136AD and s 136AD (and s 136AD, not presently relevant) that the Commissioner is satisfied that the parties to the international agreement were not dealing at arm's length with each other).Neither section makes the existence of any particular state of mind of the Commissioner in relation to the making of the determination, a condition of the power to make it.Sleight should be regarded as establishing that the legislature has revealed an intention that even in an appeal under Pt IVC of the TAA, the Commissioner's reasoning that led him to make the determination is shielded by s 177 from attack on judicial review grounds as part of the "due making" of the assessment.Of course, the fact itself of the making of the determination goes to the substantive liability to tax: if a determination was not even purportedly made, or if a determination purportedly made was not authorised by the ITAA because the statutorily prescribed conditions of the enlivening of the power were not satisfied, or, I suggest, failed to satisfy the Hickman principle, the assessment will be shown to be excessive.Consistently with Sleight , so understood, not only should the Commissioner not be ordered to provide particulars relating to judicial review grounds, but also he should not be required to give discovery, and the taxpayer should not be entitled to lead evidence or to cross-examine any witnesses called by the Commissioner, in each case in relation to such grounds .Finally, in Syngenta , Gyles J dismissed a taxpayer's motion for discovery and particulars in circumstances substantially identical to those of the present case.For reasons given by his Honour, he delivered an ex tempore judgment.Gyles J considered that an appeal to the Court assumed the existence of a valid assessment, and raised only the question whether the amount of it was excessive.This, in turn, his Honour said, involved only one issue: whether or not the actual consideration was an arm's length consideration as defined in s 136AA (see [8] above).His Honour remarked that this is an objective question, and that the Commissioner's opinion concerning it is not probative evidence in respect of it.I respectfully agree (cf Gummow J's treatment of the first separate question in Jackson ).It follows from his Honour's judgment that it is not open to a taxpayer to establish excessiveness by attacking purported par  and subs  determinations on judicial review grounds.In relation to discovery, his Honour said (at [18]):It follows of course that the discovery now sought from the Commissioner is pretty much entirely irrelevant, although I would not make a final judgment about discovery yet.That would depend upon what evidence the Commissioner calls and from whom and under what circumstances.It may be that once that is known, there will be a case for discovery or some other ancillary process.The Court will be involved in a fairly conventional valuation exercise.His Honour's reference to the discovery sought having become virtually entirely irrelevant is a reference to discovery based on judicial review grounds having become entirely irrelevant.His Honour noted that while he regarded his view as consistent with Sleight , he did not regard Sleight as necessary to his conclusion.Resolution It is difficult to reconcile all that is said in all of the authorities discussed above.I am concerned with an appeal under Pt IVC of the TAA, that is to say, a proceeding in which production of the Commissioner's notice of assessment is not conclusive evidence as to the amount or particulars of the assessment, yet is conclusive as to the due making of the assessment in other respects.Cases such as FJ Bloemen and Richard Walter are distinguishable on their facts as not being in the nature of appeals.The first reason why the Commissioner should not be required to supply the particulars sought relates to the Commissioner's primary and more general submission.I hold, in accordance with Peabody, Sleight and Syngenta , that the Commissioner should not be required to supply the particulars sought because, under the statutory provisions mentioned, it is not open to the Taxpayers to make the Commissioner's state of mind and reasoning processes leading to the making of the determinations under s 136AD an issue in the appeals.My reasoning in this respect is found largely in my discussion of Sleight and Syngenta at [136]---[150], and in particular, [144] above.The position established by Peabody (see [119] above), Sleight (see [136]---[145] above), and Syngenta (see [146]---[150] above) seems to be that a distinction is to be drawn between cases in which the ITAA specifies a state of mind on which the assessment of the amount of taxable income (and tax) depends (cf Avon Downs , George , Giris , Duggan , Brian Hatch , Kolotex , WA Capital , Dalco ), and those in which it specifies, not a state of mind, but the making of a determination, as the event on which the amount of taxable income (and tax) depends (cf Jackson , Peabody , Richard Walter , Binetter, Sleight , Syngenta ).In the latter class of case, the legislature is taken to indicate that the interaction between s 177 of the ITAA and s 14ZZO of the TAA produces the result that the Commissioner's state of mind, on the basis of which the determination was made, is part of the due making of the assessment, and cannot be put in issue by the taxpayer.Since every determination must be immediately preceded by a state of mind, namely, an opinion that the determination should be made, it may be questioned whether the state of mind/Commissioner's determination distinction is an entirely satisfactory one.But it carries the day in a situation in which the distinction between procedural steps going to substantive liability (or excessiveness of the assessment) on the one hand, and other procedural steps, on the other hand, is itself a difficult one.There are yet other cases which do not fall into the two classes mentioned (state of mind and Commissioner's determination).Examples are those arising under the former s 260 of the ITAA.I prefer not to attempt to describe this residual class in a comprehensive way, beyond saying that, subject to any indication of legislative intention, the Court retains a general discretionary power to order particulars where the justice of the case, and, in particular, the fairness of the hearing, so requires.The second reason why the Commissioner should not be required to supply the particulars sought is that he has not asserted, and does not propose to assert, a positive case as to his state of mind or reasoning processes, of which, in accordance with the general principles governing the supply of particulars, particularisation might be appropriate (cf George , (Kitto J), discussed at [46] above).In the light of ss 136AD and 177 of the ITAA and 14ZZO of the TAA, the Commissioner is entitled not to assert any particular state of mind or reasoning process, and simply to rely on his assessment.Although the Taxpayers are not at liberty to attempt to bring down the present determinations on judicial review grounds, the determinations remain vulnerable to attack in the appeals on the basis of both non-satisfaction of the statutory conditions of the Commissioner's power to make them, and the Hickman principle.CONCLUSION For the above reasons, both motions will be dismissed with costs.</doc>

Commission.Following a review of his practice profile the Commission referred Dr Selim's conduct to the fourth respondent, the Director of Professional Services Review.As a consequence of this referral Dr Selim's practice was investigated by the first respondent, the Professional Services Review Committee 309, which found that Dr Selim's conduct, in particular his high volume of services and lack of clinical input, in connection with the rendering of some of his services during the referral period constituted inappropriate practice under s 82 of the Health Insurance Act 1973  (' HIA ').Dr Selim sought review of the decisions made by the first and fourth respondents under ss 5 and 6 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977  and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 .In his amended application for review, the applicant also sought a declaration, on constitutional grounds, that Part VAA of the HIA is invalid .In the alternative he sought declarations that Part VAA is invalid in so far as it relates to the applicant or, in the further alternative, that ss 82 , 86 and 106U are invalid.On 29 October 2004 Jacobsen J made an order severing the constitutional questions and providing for the hearing of the claims for judicial review, which his Honour dismissed on 7 February 2005.These reasons concern only the constitutional questions.The applicant challenges the constitutional validity of the Professional Services Review Scheme ('PSR Scheme') contained in Part VAA of the HIA on the grounds that it is beyond the legislative power of the Commonwealth and because it infringes the prohibition against civil conscription in s 51 (xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution .In the alternative the applicant contends that ss 82 , 86 and 106U are invalid for the same reasons.Section 51 (xxiiiA) of the Constitution provides:The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution , have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to: xxiiiA) the provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorize any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances;' The Medicare Scheme The PSR Scheme is designed to prevent abuse of the Medicare and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ('Medicare Scheme').The fundamental elements of the Medicare Scheme were summarised in the written submissions of the respondent to which the applicant made no objection.I gratefully adopt that summary, which (not including footnotes) is as follows:The Medicare scheme is established under the Health Insurance Act 1973 .The Act was one of the pieces of legislation enacted as a result of the historic joint sitting of the houses of the Federal Parliament in 1974.Its long title is 'An Act providing for Payments by way of Medical Benefits and Payments for Hospital Services and for other purposes.Part II of the Act deals with Medicare Benefits.Section 10 provides for the payment of benefits for 'medical expenses ... incurred in respect of a professional service' rendered to an eligible person.A 'professional service' is, relevantly, a service to which an item in the general medical services table prescribed by the regulations relates, rendered by a medical practitioner, that is generally accepted in the medical profession as being necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient to whom it is rendered.The provisions of the Act relating to payments by way of medical benefits were enacted pursuant to s 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution .Under the Act, Medicare benefits are calculated by reference to the fees ('Schedule fees') for medical services set out in the tables prescribed in the Regulations.At the relevant time the amount of the benefit for each service was 85% of the Schedule fee.To assist medical practitioners and the public, the tables (including the rules for their interpretation) in the Regulations are published annually by the Department of Health and Ageing in a publication entitled, 'Medicare Benefits Schedule Book', which is provided to all practitioners.Medicare benefits are payable by the Health Insurance Commission ('Commission') on behalf of the Commonwealth to the patient.However, a patient may enter into an agreement with the practitioner under which the patient assigns to the practitioner the right to payment of the Medicare benefit.If such an agreement is entered into, the practitioner must accept the assignment in full payment of the medical expenses incurred in respect of the service.Assignments provide the means by which the practitioner 'bulk-bills' the Commission in respect of services which attracted Medicare benefits.In oral submissions, Mr Robertson SC who appeared for the respondents referred at length to the provision the scheme makes for a patient to assign his or her right to a benefit under the Medicare Scheme to the doctor who provides the medical service.He stressed that the practitioner's decision to accept an assignment of the benefit is entirely voluntary; there is no compulsion for any doctor to 'bulk-bill'.The PSR Scheme The PSR Scheme was introduced in 1994 and was amended in 1997, 1999 and 2002.It is the 1999 version that is relevant to this proceeding; that is the HIA as amended by the Health Insurance Amendment (Professional Services Review) Act 1999  and the Health Legislation Amendment Act (No 3) 1999 , (together the Amending Acts) .The scheme establishes a process for examining the conduct of a practitioner, in connection with the supply of services which attract a payment under Medicare, in order to determine if the practitioner has engaged in 'inappropriate practice'.Key concept and definitions Section 80 of the HIA establishes 'inappropriate practice' as the key concept of the PSR.Referring to Part VAA it provides: This Part creates a scheme under which a person's conduct can be examined to ascertain whether inappropriate practice (see section 82) is involved.It also provides for action that can be taken in response to inappropriate practice.Inappropriate practice' is defined in s 82 as follows:A practitioner engages in inappropriate practice if the practitioner's conduct in connection with rendering or initiating services is such that a Committee could reasonably conclude that: if the practitioner rendered or initiated the referred services as a general practitioner - the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners; or A person (including a practitioner) engages in inappropriate practice if the person: knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes, or knowingly, recklessly or negligently permits, a practitioner employed by the person to engage in conduct that constitutes inappropriate practice by the practitioner within the meaning or subsection ; or A Committee must, in determining whether a practitioner's conduct in connection with the rendering or initiating services was inappropriate practice, have regard to (as well as to other relevant matters) whether or not the practitioner kept adequate and contemporaneous records of the rendering or initiation of the services.Definitions Other relevant definitions are found in s 81 and apply in the absence of a contrary intention:adjudicative referral means a referral made by the Director to a Committee under section 93.Director means the Director of Professional Services Review appointed under section 83.investigative referral means: a referral made by the Commission to the Director under subsection 86; or a referral made by a Committee to the Director under subsection 106H.practitioner means: a medical practitioner; or referral means an investigative referral or an adjudicative referral, as the context requires.referral period means the period applicable under subsection 86 or , as the case may be.referred services means: in relation to an investigative referral - the services particulars of which are contained in the referral in accordance with paragraph 86; or in relation to: an adjudicative referral; or the consideration by the Determining Authority of a report of a Committee on an adjudicative referral; the services to which the referral relates.service means: a service for which, at the time it was rendered or initiated, medicare benefit was payable; or a service rendered by way of prescribing or dispensing of a pharmaceutical benefit by a medical practitioner or a dental practitioner.Investigative referrals Under s 86 the Health Insurance Commission ('Commission') may refer the conduct of a practitioner to the Director to investigate whether the practitioner had been engaging in inappropriate conduct in relation to the rendering or initiation of services:Commission may refer matters to the Director The Commission may, in writing, refer to the Director the conduct of a person relating to one or both of the following: whether the person has engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with rendering of services; whether the person has engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with initiation of services.An investigative referral in relation to the rendering of services may only relate to services rendered during the 2 year period immediately preceding the referral, whether or not any or all of the services were initiated before the start of that period.An investigative referral in relation to the initiation of services may only relate to services initiated during the 2 year period immediately preceding the referral.An investigative referral must: contain particulars of all services rendered or initiated during the referral period by: the person under review; or a practitioner employed by the person under review; or a practitioner employed by a body corporate of which the person under review is an officer; and set out the reasons why the Commission considers the person under review may have engaged in inappropriate practice.After the Commission has made an investigative referral, the Director may request the Commission to give him or her further information relating to any services particulars of which are contained in the referral whether or not the services to which the request relates are dealt with in reasons given by the Commission under paragraph ...' Additional requirements for the content and form of investigative referrals are found in ss 87 and 88 which provide:Content and form of investigative referrals An investigative referral must specify whether it relates to one or both of the following: specified services; services rendered or initiated by a practitioner that are one or more of the following: services of a specified class; services provided to a specified class of persons; services provided within a specified location; services provided within a specified period.Procedure for notifying investigative referrals The Commission must send a copy of the investigative referral to the person under review within 48 hours of sending the investigative referral to the Director.The copy must be accompanied by a notice inviting the person under review to make written submissions to the Director, within 14 days, stating why the Director should dismiss the referral without setting up a Committee.Within the 14 day period commencing on the day on which the person under review is sent the copy and notice, he or she may make such written submissions to the Director.Once an investigative referral has been made the Director must conduct an investigation into the referred services, which may encompass services not dealt with in the reasons given by the Commission under paragraph 86, in any manner he or she thinks appropriate.Adjudicative referrals Following his investigation the Director may establish a Committee and make an adjudicative referral to it to consider whether the practitioner has engaged in inappropriate practice.The Director may make written guidelines about the content and form of adjudicative referrals.The Committee may only make findings about the services that are the subject of the adjudicative referral; s 106H.Inappropriate practice With effect from 1 July 1994 the concept of inappropriate practice was introduced into the HIA by the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994 ; the ' Review Act'.Before that the concept of 'excessive services' or over-servicing, was the criterion by which practitioners' conduct was judged.Section 79 of the HIA, the predecessor to s 82, provided that a reference to excessive services, is a reference to professional services (other than pathology services), being services in respect of which medicare benefit has become or may become payable and which were not reasonably necessary for adequate medical or dental care of the patient concerned.The applicant claims that, unlike 'excessive services', inappropriate practice (in relation to general practitioners) can be anything that three other general practitioners constituted as a Committee by the Director pursuant to s 93 of the HIA, consider it to be.In support of this submission the applicant referred to the Explanatory Memorandum to the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill 1993 (which became the Review Act ) which says:New Proposed Section 82 --- Definitions of inappropriate practice Section 82 defines a new concept, to be known as "inappropriate practice".It encompasses the existing concepts of excessive rendering and excessive initiating but also introduces the concept of excessive prescribing.In addition, it will allow a Committee to examine, where relevant, aspects of a practitioner's practice broader than purely the excessive servicing of patients.A Committee will have the capacity to consider the conduct of the person under review in his or her practice and determine whether that conduct is acceptable to the general body of his or her profession or specialty.In his second reading speech the Minister referred to the concept of inappropriate practice saying,a significant change in the bill is the replacement of the concept of excessive servicing with one of inappropriate practice.Whereas excessive servicing is currently defined as the rendering or initiation of services not reasonably necessary for the adequate care of the patient, the concept of inappropriate practice goes further.It covers a practitioner engaging in conduct in connection with the rendering or initiation of services that is unacceptable to his or her professional colleagues generally.The applicant also referred to the Report of the Review Committee of the Professional Services Review Scheme, Commonwealth, 1999 at pp 15-16 where categories of conduct identified as involving inappropriate practice include:concerns about clinical competence and performance;aberrant professional behaviour or beliefs;lack of meaningful continuing medical education;physical or mental impairment;substance abuse;organisational issues affecting safety (such as equipment and staffing deficiencies);high number of services per patient;unusual incidence of specific types of services;inappropriate prescribing;inappropriate ordering of diagnostic imaging and pathology;inappropriate use of Medicare item numbers when making claims; andhigh numbers of services per day with low rates of consultation services per patient.Under s 106U of the HIA, the sanctions attached to a finding of inappropriate practice range from reprimand or counselling to substantial monetary penalties and disqualification from participating in the Medicare Scheme for up to three years.Submissions as to personal hardship Before dealing in any detail with the parties' submissions on the constitutional point, I should make some preliminary observations about the evidence proffered by the applicant and the applicant's submissions concerning the possible consequences of the adverse decisions that have already been made with respect to his conduct and his consequent exposure to sanctions.The applicant sought to put certain evidence before the Court including affidavits of Dr Selim and various other extrinsic materials such as explanatory memoranda to relevant legislation.The respondents did not object to the applicant relying on the extrinsic material although they made the point, correctly in my view, that such material is not evidence.They did object to evidence concerning Dr Selim's personal circumstances on the grounds that this evidence is not relevant to the debate as to the constitutional validity of the PSR Scheme.They submit that whether Part VAA is valid does not depend on its impact on the applicant as an individual; it cannot be the case that Part VAA is invalid with respect to the applicant and valid for everyone else.For this reason the factual propositions relevant to the constitutional challenge must be put at a general and not an individual level.It is for this reason, it is submitted, that the leading cases on s 51(xxiiiA) have not had an individual's personal circumstances as their factual base but have proceeded by way of a demurrer to a fully pleaded statement of claim or on a case stated.I agree with these submissions.There is no challenge to Dr Selim's standing to bring the present proceeding.The respondents have accepted that should the applicant be disqualified from participating in the Medicare Scheme, then for the period of the disqualification the applicant's patients would not receive benefits in respect of the applicant's professional services.The respondents accept that, depending on the length of any disqualification the applicant 'may lose a number of his patients'.The pervasiveness of the Medicare Scheme and its role in covering an individual's medical expenses or, at least, in subsidising those expenses, is sufficiently well known generally as to allow me to take judicial notice of this and of its impact on medical practitioners who are unable to participate in the scheme; Holland v Jones [1917] HCA 26 ; (1917) 23 CLR 149 ; Evidence Act 1995  s 144.It is not difficult to conclude that the consequences for a medical practitioner who is excluded from the scheme would be sufficiently serious.The disadvantages of operating outside the Medicare Scheme are such as, in my view, to impose practical, if not legal compulsion, to participate in the Scheme.The written submissions made on behalf of the applicant went into considerable detail about the repercussions for the applicant should he be disqualified from the Medicare Benefits Scheme for up to three years.These included the virtual devastation of his practice and loss of his livelihood.As I have explained above these submissions are not relevant to the issue I have to decide.The applicant sought judicial review of the decisions of the Director and the Committee.Jacobson J dismissed that application.I understand that, pending the outcome of the present constitutional challenge to the legislation, no penalties have been imposed on the applicant.Whether or not hardship submissions will be relevant to the assessment of any penalty is not for me to say.The issue of whether the PSR exceeds the powers of the Commonwealth however, cannot depend on issues of hardship particular to an individual practitioner.Civil conscription --- the applicant's submissions It is not in contention that medical practitioners are not obliged to participate in the Medicare Scheme.Nevertheless, the applicant contends that the realities underlying the medical benefits scheme are such that 'realistically, economically and practically' it requires medical practitioners to become approved medical providers in order for them to practise as general practitioners.The applicant submits that the HIA requires general practitioners to provide medical services in a manner designated as 'appropriate' but which is 'unstated and undefined'.According to the applicant, this dictates the 'kinds of and manner in which medical services are actually provided' and attaches significant sanctions to a failure to conform including disqualification from participation in the scheme for up to three years, public reprimand and/or the imposition of substantial repayments of Medicare benefits paid to them or assigned to them by their patients.By so doing, the applicant submits, the HIA 'impermissibly' constitutes civil conscription.Elaborating on this submission the applicant contends that the financial consequences of not participating in the Medicare Scheme create a formidable and real compulsion for general practitioners to do whatever is necessary to enable them to participate.What is required, it is submitted, goes to the actual medical services to be delivered as well as to the mode or manner of their delivery.The applicant submitted:The Commonwealth is now therefore present in between , as it were, the general practitioner and his or her patient and the kind of medical service delivered by the practitioner, or whether such service is delivered at all, is untaken by the practitioner having to have strict regard to ... the Commonwealth's requirements.The Commonwealth is now empowered to intervene in the actual professional delivery of medical services.In making these submissions the applicant relies on the decision of the High Court in The General Practitioners Society in Australia v Commonwealth of Australia [1980] HCA 30 ; (1980) 145 CLR 532 ('General Practitioners case').In the alternative the applicant submits that:GPS is distinguishable and does not apply to the present case; and/or the construction of 'civil conscription' in GPS is incorrect and should not be accepted by this Court.Rather, it is submitted, the broader view of what constitutes 'civil conscription' taken by Latham CJ, Rich, Williams and Webb JJ in Federal Council of the British Medical Association in Australia v Commonwealth [1949] HCA 44 ; (1949) 79 CLR 201 ('BMA case') should be accepted.At the outset I should dispose of the submission in .It is not open to this Court to say that a decision of the High Court of Australia is incorrect.If, contrary to my view, the General Practitioners case and the BMA case are not reconcilable then the General Practitioners case, being the later decision, must prevail.In the present proceeding, unless it is relevantly distinguishable from the circumstances under consideration here, the General Practitioners case must be applied.Background to s 51(xxiiiA) Section 51(xxiiiA) was inserted into the Constitution by amendment pursuant to s 128 of the Constitution .The proposed amendment had been approved by the necessary majorities of electors and was assented to on 19 December 1946.In explaining the background to this amendment in BMA at 285 , Williams J referred to the different views as to the proper scope of s 81 of the Constitution (Commonwealth power of appropriation) expressed in Attorney-General for Victoria v Commonwealth [1945] HCA 30 ; (1945) 71 CLR 237 (' Pharmaceutical Benefits Case') and to the likelihood, if the point arose for decision, that a majority of the Court would hold that the Commonwealth could only expend its money on those forms of social services expressly authorised by the Constitution , namely invalid and old age pensions authorised by s 51(xxiii).The extension of Commonwealth power to the provision of the benefits enumerated in s 51(xxiiiA) had been put beyond doubt by the amendment and concerns that the extension of power might lead to the nationalisation of medical and dental professions were met by the prohibition of civil conscription; see also D Mendelson, "Devaluation of a Constitutional Guarantee: The History of Section 51(xxiiiA) of the Commonwealth Constitution " (1999) 23 MULR 308 .High Court consideration of s 51(xxiiiA) The BMA case In the BMA case , the High Court held that the prohibition against civil conscription in s 51(xxiiiA) applied only to medical and dental services and not to the other elements of the section.At issue was the validity of s 7A of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1947  which required medical practitioners to use a prescribed form and adhere to a prescribed list of pharmaceuticals in writing a prescription if their patients were to be entitled to free pharmaceutical benefits.It was an offence, carrying a penalty of [sterling]50, for a medical practitioner to write a prescription other than in the statutory form unless asked to do so by the person for whom or at whose request the prescription was written.The majority of the High Court (Latham CJ, Rich, Williams and Webb JJ, Dixon and McTiernan JJ dissenting) held that the section imposed a form of civil conscription contrary to the prohibition in s 51(xxiiiA).Latham CJ emphasised, at 243, that the power given to the Commonwealth under s 51(xxiiiA) is not a power to make laws with respect to pharmaceutical benefits and medical services but for the provision of such benefits and service.The Chief Justice accepted that in providing such benefits and services, the Commonwealth was entitled to rely upon the existing 'position in the community', that is, a system whereby private doctors prescribe medicine.His Honour found that the incidental power derived from s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution entitled the Commonwealth, when providing benefits out of public moneys, to take precautions so as to prevent injury to the public and the useless or dishonest expenditure of public moneys.The Chief Justice also said (at 249) that the term 'civil conscription' is wider than 'industrial conscription' and is applicable to "any compulsion of law requiring that men should engage in a particular occupation, perform particular work, or perform work in a particular way.The Chief Justice emphasised that the words 'any form of' in s 51(xxiiiA) evinced an intention on the part of the Parliament to ensure that any service to which the limitation applied should be 'completely voluntary'.Considering s 7A, his Honour accepted that a doctor might escape the penalty by not writing a prescription but noted that if a doctor could not carry on practice without writing many prescriptions included in the prescribed list, the doctor is not given any live option.Given that the doctor had no power or right to procure or control a request that he not use the Commonwealth forms then he either had to use them or go out of practice.The Chief Justice viewed this as a very real form of compulsion commenting (at 253):There could in my opinion be no more effective means of compulsion than is to be found in a legal provision that unless a person acts in a particular way he shall not be allowed to earn his living in that way, and possibly in the only way, in which he is qualified to earn a living.Webb J expressed a similar view at 292-3.Williams J was also not prepared to confine the operation of the constitutional prohibition to direct legal compulsion; at 287.In his Honour's view, however, the fact that s 7A carried a penalty for non-compliance implied legal compulsion and by compelling medical practitioners, in the absence of a relevant request to the contrary, to write prescriptions on forms supplied by the Commonwealth, the section compelled the provision of a medical service to the Commonwealth.Williams J summarised his view at 289:The scheme of the Act is to make the provision of a pharmaceutical benefit conditional upon a medical practitioner prescribing particular treatment, so that in prescribing that treatment the medical practitioner is rendering a medical service to the Commonwealth.He is in effect certifying to the Commonwealth that the patient requires a pharmaceutical benefit within the meaning of the Act.He is compelled to render that service in the course of rendering a contractual service to his patient.But it is a service which forms no part of the implied contract for services created by a patient seeking the advice and treatment of a medical practitioner and the medical practitioner examining the patient with a view to giving him advice and treatment.It is a compulsory service to the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Act which is super-imposed upon the contract of the parties.It is a compulsory service whether the obligation is absolute or absolute unless performance is excused by the person in respect of whom or at whose request the prescription is written.The aspects of the legislation that had led Webb J to conclude that the legislation involved a compulsory medical service were clearly identified by his Honour at 294:To reiterate: if s 7A had not been enacted a patient requesting a doctor to write a prescription on the Commonwealth form, which involves consulting and consideration of the Commonwealth Pharmaceutical Formulary or its addendum or both, would request a service which only a doctor can render, and which therefore is properly described as a medical service.But when this service is made compulsory by a fine, or loss of practice to avoid the fine ...then, having regard not only to the extent of the professional work involved but to the almost unlimited number of persons entitled to insist on the service at any time, it becomes, I think, not merely a compulsory service but a form of civil conscription within any meaning that can be given to that expression which, if not quite clear, was certainly intended to be comprehensive.It is civil conscription of doctors as doctors.His Honour's comments on these aspects of the legislation are particularly instructive in the present proceeding.The General Practitioners case The only other case in which the High Court has considered the meaning of 'civil conscription' in any detail is the General Practitioners case .Certain provisions of the HIA (ss 16A, 16B and 16C) and regulations made under the Act imposed conditions to be met before Commonwealth medical benefits were payable in respect of pathology services (other than prescribed pathology services) and also imposed obligations on some, at least, of the persons providing those services.It was necessary for those services to be provided by or on behalf of an 'approved pathology practitioner'.The conditions and obligations were designed to prevent the supply of unnecessary or excessive pathology services.The legislative provisions operated in conjunction with an undertaking to be provided by approved pathology practitioners and a code of conduct.They had no application to a medical practitioner who was prepared to render pathology services for which no medical benefit would be payable and there was no legal compulsion on any medical practitioner to become an approved pathology practitioner.The arguments put to the Court that the legislation imposed a form of civil conscription were summarised by Gibbs J at 549:First, it was said that the laws positively require a practitioner to perform services of a medical kind.Secondly, it was said, the laws, by prohibiting practitioners from carrying on practice in what was formerly the normal way, compel them to carry on practice in a different way.it was argued for the plaintiffs that few practitioners would be able to attract patients, or to make a living from their profession, if medical benefits were not payable in respect of their services, and that therefore, if ss 16A, 16B and 16C are valid, a practitioner who intends to render pathology services (whether as a specialist or as a general practitioner) is compelled by practical considerations to apply to become an approved pathology practitioner.His Honour accepted that the facts in the case stated for the consideration of the High Court established that the provisions in question left some medical practitioners with no real choice if they wished to preserve their practices.It would be necessary for them to become approved pathology practitioners, and for that purpose they would have to submit to the obligations imposed by the statute, the undertaking and the regulations.Referring to the BMA case, Gibbs J clearly stated, at 550:The question whether a law imposes civil conscription cannot be answered in the negative simply because the law does not create any legal liability to perform any medical or dental service; the effect of the law in the economic and other circumstances must be considered, and practical compulsion is enough.To answer the question it was necessary to examine the provisions of the Act, regulations and undertaking more closely.His Honour noted first, at 554, that mere compulsion for a medical practitioner to seek to become an approved pathology practitioner could not in itself 'amount to the imposition of any form of civil conscription'.Accordingly, his Honour focussed in particular upon those provisions which had the effect of compelling medical practitioners to observe certain positive requirements.Those provisions involved the requirement to make (or confirm) requests in writing, to give details of the relevant service in the handwriting of the person making the request and to record other particulars as required by the regulation.The approved pathology practitioner was also required to retain certain records for 18 months, to ensure that his employees acted in accordance with the legislation and to furnish information as required by the Minister from time to time.In relation to these provisions his Honour said, at 559-60:The provisions in question in these proceedings do compel medical practitioners to perform certain duties in the course of carrying out their medical practices, but they do not go beyond regulating the manner in which some of the incidents of those practices are carried out, and they do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical services.Most of the duties imposed relate only to things done incidentally in the course of practice, rather than to a medical service itself.Gibbs J disagreed with observations by some members of the majority in the BMA case (Latham CJ at 249, Williams J at 290 and Webb J at 294) to the effect that 'a law which compels people to perform services in a particular manner is a law which imposes civil conscription'.At 557, Gibbs J explained his disagreement thus:That expression, ['any form of civil conscription'] used in its natural meaning, and applied, as the context of par.xxiiiA) requires, to medical and dental services, refers to any sort of compulsion to engage in practice as a doctor or a dentist or to perform particular medical or dental services.However, in its natural meaning it does not refer to compulsion to do, in a particular way, some act in the course of carrying on practice or performing a service, when there is no compulsion to carry on the practice or perform the service.it could not properly be said that it would be a form of civil conscription to require a person who had voluntarily engaged in civilian employment to perform the duties of that employment in accordance with the instructions given to him by his employers.There is nothing in the Constitution that would indicate that the expression "any form of civil conscription" where it appears s 51(xxiiiA) should be given an enlarged meaning which its words do not naturally bear.The words "any form of" do not, in my opinion, extend the meaning of "conscription", and that word connotes compulsion to serve rather than regulation of the manner in which a service is performed.Of course no express power is conferred on the Parliament to make laws to regulate the manner of performance of medical or dental services, but it appears clearly necessary to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA) that the Parliament should be able to make laws as to the way in which medical and dental services provided by the Commonwealth under the authority of that paragraph are performed, and laws annexing conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided under that authority even if those conditions may have the result that a medical or dental service must be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained.I find it impossible to discern in the words in parenthesis in par.xxiiiA) any intention to prevent the Parliament from making laws of that kind, provided that no compulsion to serve is imposed.Gibbs J added that he agreed with the opinion expressed in by Dixon J in the BMA case, that there is a wide distinction between regulating the manner in which an incident of medical practice is carried on (if and when it is done) and the compulsion to serve medically or to render medical services, the latter, but not the former, being within the prohibition.Despite the disagreement outlined in the passage quoted above, Gibbs J did not regard the BMA case as wrongly decided as it could be supported on narrower grounds.His Honour identified the fatal elements in the legislation considered in the BMA case as being:that s 7A required a doctor to write any prescriptions for any medicine included in the prescribed list on the form supplied by the Commonwealth irrespective of whether the medicines were to be obtained free.This requirement had no necessary relationship with any pharmaceutical benefit or medical services provided by the Commonwealth; and 2. in the light of its history and context, s 7A could be seen to intend to compel medical practitioners to join the Commonwealth scheme for the provision of free pharmaceutical benefits and to provide 'against their will' a medical service for the Commonwealth.Gibbs J felt that these elements sufficiently distinguished the position under s 7A from that under consideration in the General Practitioners case; see [36] above.The only medical service that the provisions in question compelled was, possibly, that required by s 16A of the HIA , namely that a request by medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render an approved pathology service should be made or confirmed in writing.Although Gibbs J thought that such a request might be regarded as a medical service he held that the section did not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request.Rather it required that the request, if made , be in writing.Subject to the points made below in [42]-[43], and to some additional observations that are not relevant here, the other members of the High Court agreed with Gibbs J that the provisions under consideration did not impose compulsion amounting to 'civil conscription'.Although it is clear that Gibbs J was of the opinion that practical compulsion, as distinct from legal compulsion, is sufficient to satisfy the concept of 'civil conscription', given the High Court's interpretation of the legislation under consideration in the General Practitioners case it was not necessary to decide this point.Indeed, Barwick CJ, Mason J and Wilson J all left this question open.Barwick CJ additionally commented that he did not read the decision of the majority in the BMA case as deciding the issue adding, at 537-8: But that is not to say that, in my opinion, civil conscription could not in any case result from the coercive force of circumstance: but, in my opinion, to make out such a case would need an extremely strong set of circumstances which, in real terms, left the individual with no choice but to submit to what the statute required, though it did not command it.The other four members of the High Court accepted that practical compulsion was sufficient to breach the constitutional prohibition on civil conscription and clearly regarded the majority of the High Court in the BMA case as having decided the issue; per Gibbs J (with whom Stephen J agreed) at 550 and 556; per Murphy J at 565, per Aickin J at 565.In summary, the General Practitioners case decided there was no compulsion (legal or otherwise) to provide medical services amounting to any form of civil conscription because:the practical compulsion on practitioners to become approved pathology practitioners was not a compulsion to provide medical services even though the practitioners had no real choice if they wished to preserve their practices; see Gibbs J at 554; the provisions which did compel medical practitioners to observe certain positive requirements compelled acts that were reasonably incidental to the provision of medical services and were required only after a voluntary decision to provide the medical services had been taken; regulation of the manner in which an incident of medical practice is carried on is incidental to the power of the Commonwealth to provide medical services and, so long as no compulsion to serve is imposed, is outside the prohibition.Interpretation of Part VAA I have gone into considerable detail in analysing the General Practitioners case because, in my view, the principles for which it stands apply to the present circumstances and inexorably lead to the conclusion that Part VAA of the HIA does not provide for any form of civil conscription.The General Practitioners case clearly shows, however, that careful examination of the specific requirements of challenged legislation is crucial to the determination of whether the constitutional prohibition has been breached.The salient features of the Medicare Scheme and the PSR Scheme are outlined in [5] --- [13] above.As can be seen, there is no legal compulsion for a medical practitioner to participate in the Medicare Scheme any more than there was for medical practitioners to become approved pathology providers under the legislation considered in the General Practitioners case.I accept that here, as there in the General Practitioners case, there is a form of compulsion in that it may be severely detrimental, if not fatal, to the viability of a medical practice if the practitioner were excluded from the Medicare Scheme.The General Practitioners case clearly establishes, however, that such compulsion is neither a legal nor a practical compulsion to provide a medical service and is not affected by the constitutional prohibition; see [36] above.It is not clear exactly what the High Court meant by 'practical compulsion' but the acceptance ('with equanimity' as Mr Robertson observed) in the General Practitioners case of the fact that a pathologist who did not participate in the statutory scheme under consideration might not have a viable practice shows that such compulsion as is here involved, does not fall within the constitutional prohibition; see the General Practitioners Case at 549-50 per Gibbs J.It may be that 'practical compulsion' is a term that follows from an examination of the substance of a statute rather than mere form and is really a conclusion about that which offends the constitutional prohibition.In any event I do not need to decide that here.For the applicant to succeed he would have to show that important aspects of rendering medical services are compulsory under the Medicare Scheme, enforced by the PSR Scheme.In making this point Mr Robertson referred to the provision for assignment of benefits under the Medicare Scheme to the medical practitioner who provides the service; see [5]-[6] above.In support of his submission that a medical practitioner was entirely free to accept payment by way of assignment of the benefit he referred to the comments to this effect in Health Insurance Commission v Peverill [1994] HCA 8 ; (1994) 179 CLR 226 at 235 per Mason CJ, Deane and Gaudron JJ.As Mr Robertson explained, a doctor can charge whatever fee he likes for his services; it is only where he voluntarily accepts assignment as full payment that his fee is limited to the amount that the Commonwealth is prepared to pay.The fact that the practitioner may be financially advantaged in deciding to accept an assignment does not make the provision compulsory.As explained at [7] --- [18] above, the PSR Scheme provides for a practitioner's conduct to be examined to determine if he or she has engaged in 'inappropriate practice'.The consequences attached to a finding of inappropriate practice show that, as the name suggests, the purpose of the provisions is to prevent inappropriate practice rather than to compel the provision of medical services.Such a simple analysis is, of course, not sufficient to resolve the issues raised by the applicant but it does make clear that the thrust of the provisions is to regulate the conduct of medical practitioners, including the way in which they provide medical services.The applicant accepts that regulating the incidents of medical practice does not offend the constitutional prohibition but contends that the PSR Scheme does more than regulate the incidents of medical practice.It does not merely regulate the number of services provided or the administrative incidents of medical practice but, it is submitted, the Scheme trespasses into the actual medical services provided not just the manner in which they are provided; it affects the practitioner's clinical decision whether or not to provide a particular service.This feature alone, the applicant contends, distinguishes the present-day system from that considered by the High Court in the General Practitioners case.In my view this submission does not take sufficient account of Gibbs J's express statement in the General Practitioner's case (see [37] above) that Parliament has the power to make laws as to the manner in which medical services are performed where such laws are 'clearly necessary' to the effective exercise of the Commonwealth's power to provide medical and dental services.It is incidental to the exercise of the power to provide medical services to be able to make such regulatory laws and to be able to annex conditions to the entitlement to any of the benefits provided, even if this means that medical or dental services have to be rendered in a particular way if the benefit is to be obtained.The making of such laws is not civil conscription provided that 'no compulsion to serve is imposed'.Therefore the issue here is whether regulation with reference to the criterion of 'inappropriate practice' is 'clearly necessary' to the effective exercise of the power conferred by s 51(xxiiiA).The High Court has cautioned that when considering the ambit of the incidental power, whether arising by implication or expressly under s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution , it is important not to allow the incidental power to dominate the main power or, as Rich J said, not to put the cart before the horse; Attorney-General for Victoria v The Commonwealth [1935] HCA 31 ; (1935) 52 CLR 533 at 563.The point was well illustrated by Dixon J in the Pharmaceutical Benefits case.The legislation under consideration there rested on the power of the Commonwealth to appropriate money under s 81 of the Constitution .Dixon J concluded that even if one accepted that s 81 authorised the expenditure of money on any purpose that the Parliament might think fit without restriction, the scheme established under the legislation would still be invalid.His Honour, at 270, put the point thus:T] he fact is that under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act appropriation of money is the consequence of the plan; the plan is not consequential upon or incidental to the appropriation of money.Since the Pharmaceutical Benefits case, s 51(xxiiiA) has, of course, authorised the provision of services that were not possible under the previous constitutional arrangements.However, as the General Practitioners case shows, the incidental power is still relevant in an assessment of the constitutional standing of the PSR.The applicant accepts that matters 'merely incidental to the core of clinical practice of medicine' do not fall within the constitutional prohibition because they might constitute a necessary part of the Commonwealth's administration of its benefits scheme.In the applicant's written submissions such incidental matters are said to include requirements about completing forms or with respect to accounts and receipts or financial and administrative matters.The applicant does not accept that it is incidental to the Commonwealth's provision of medical services either that it has the power to impose a standard which the services provided have to meet or the power to discipline medical practitioners whose services fail to meet that standard.The applicant is correct that the regulation implicit in the concept of inappropriate practice is capable of going to the heart of medical services rather than merely to ancillary aspects.Whether that is different from merely regulating the incidents of medical services I do not need to decide, although I suspect that it is not.Ultimately however, I do not accept that a constitutional provision that empowers the Commonwealth to provide medical services, including through the existing network of medical practitioners, at the same time prohibits it from imposing standards on the medical services provided.Such standards are integral to the responsible provision of medical services and, as Latham CJ recognised in the BMA case, the Commonwealth's incidental power entitles it to provide for such matters as well as to take the necessary precautions to ensure that public money is properly used; see [29] above.A disciplinary system that is directed to support such precautions (as opposed to a free-standing disciplinary system) would also fall within the incidental power of the Commonwealth even if it could otherwise be viewed as exceeding the power of the Commonwealth because it can be characterised as, for example, a law with respect to the regulation of medical practice.As the High Court observed in Alexandra Private Geriatric Hospital Proprietary Limitetd v Commonwealth [1987] HCA 6 ; (1987) 162 CLR 271 at 279:A single law can possess more than one character and it suffices for constitutional validity if any one or more of those characters fairly falls within a head of Commonwealth legislative power.The applicant contends that the concept of inappropriate practice could be anything that a Committee considers it to be; that it could extend to any conduct of the practitioner.This submission cannot be sustained.Section 80 shows that 'inappropriate practice' is a subset of a person's conduct; it refers to examining a person's conduct to ascertain if there has been 'inappropriate practice'.Inappropriate practice is defined in s 82 (see [8] above).The definition restricts the concept to conduct 'in connection with rendering or initiating [medical] services' and provides that it must be such that the Committee could 'reasonably conclude' that the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners.The context indicates that the grounds on which the conduct is to be judged must relate to the services that are rendered or initiated.Moreover, the Explanatory Memorandum quoted above at [15] indicates that the relevant conduct is conduct in the course of the practice of medicine.Were a Committee to attempt to label as 'inappropriate practice' conduct of a medical practitioner that is unrelated to the provision of medical services the appropriate challenge would be, not to the constitutional validity of the PSR, but to the accuracy of the committee's interpretation of the concept.This point was made in Yung v Adams (1997) 80 FCR 453 at 459 where Davies J observed that, notwithstanding the width of the definition of 'inappropriate conduct', it should be read subject to the legislative power under which the Act was passed:The Federal Parliament has no general power to regulate the activities of medical practitioners.Therefore, under Pt VAA, the power to discipline in relation to "inappropriate practice" must be understood as a power to discipline in relation to conduct which is related to the payments which are made by the Commonwealth under the Act by way of medical benefits and the like.Accordingly, the reference to "inappropriate practice" in s 82 refers to conduct in relation to which Commonwealth benefits were paid or payable and in respect of which the medical practitioner failed in some way to meet the standards of the general body of the members of the profession in which the services were rendered.The Commonwealth's interest is to see that the services which are provided by a medical practitioner and for which a Commonwealth benefit is or may be claimed are services in respect of which the medical practitioner provides due care and skill, that a claim if made is brought under the correct item and that overservicing does not occur.The applicant contends that the comments of Gibbs J quoted at [37] above are not to be taken as stating a 'blanket proposition' that any regulation of the manner in which practice is conducted is within power.This is clearly correct.However, his Honour's statement that:If the incident of practice which is regulated is not medical or dental, but financial or administrative, it is clearly outside the prohibition', cannot be used, as the applicant attempts to do, as authority for the proposition that any attempt to regulate an incident of practice which is medical or dental will fall within the prohibition.The applicant puts forward the General Practitioners case as authority for the blanket proposition that it is constitutionally impermissible to regulate any performance by medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions; that such regulation was equated with compulsion and therefore with conscription.This however is not what is held in the General Practitioners case.What was crucial for Gibbs J in the General Practitioners case was that no medical service was compelled.This is quite clear from his Honour's comments at 559-60:The provisions in question in these proceedings do compel medical practitioners to perform certain duties in the course of carrying out their medical practices, but they do not go beyond regulating the manner in which some of the incidents of those practices are carried out, and they do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical services.Most of the duties imposed relate only to things done incidentally in the course of practice, rather than to a medical service itself.The only possible exception is s 16A , which requires that a request by a medical practitioner to an approved pathology practitioner to render a pathology service shall be made or confirmed in writing as prescribed.A request of that kind may be regarded as a medical service.However, s 16A does not compel any medical practitioner to make such a request.What it requires is that the request, if made, be made or confirmed by written instrument which satisfies reg.There is nothing in that regulation which affects in the slightest the performance by a medical practitioner of his medical duties and functions.The statutory requirements may impose on him more administrative work.In particular he is required to specify, in his own handwriting, the services to which the instrument relates, and cannot simply mark a form on which is printed a list of possible services.The reason why a condition of this kind is attached to the entitlement to medical benefits is no doubt that the use of the printed form might reasonably be regarded as likely to contribute to laxity and to facilitate fraud.However that may be, to require a practitioner to write out particulars of the service which he has decided to request another practitioner to perform is not to compel the practitioner making the request to perform a medical service.Even more clearly, the requirements of s 16A with regard to accounts and receipts, and those of s 16A with regard to the retention and production of any written request or confirmation, do not compel any medical practitioner to perform any medical service.For these reasons none of the provisions in question imposes any form of civil conscription contrary to s 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution .I have quoted his Honour's comments at length to make quite clear his Honour's position.His Honour found that the provisions in question did not breach the constitutional prohibition because, put simply, that which was compelled was not a medical service in itself; although it may have been incidental to a medical service; and where a medical service was regulated, as by requiring a request to be made in writing, the medical service itself was not compelled.These comments do not support the proposition that any regulation of the way in which a medical service is provided is unconstitutional.In my view the General Practitioners case is directly applicable to the present situation.For the reasons I have given I do not find that the Medicare Scheme or the PSR Scheme impose any compulsion to provide medical services.The decision to provide medical services is a voluntary decision.The regulation of the manner in which such services are provided is properly incidental to the Commonwealth's power under s 51(xxiiiA) to provide medical services and does not offend the constitutional prohibition against civil conscription.In my view a proper application of the term 'inappropriate practice' would sufficiently confine the concept to matters which are within the incidental power of the Commonwealth.For the above reasons the applicant's challenge to the constitutional validity of PSR Scheme must fail.The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</doc>

(2000) 99 FCR 56 at [48] - [67] .Cadbury further submitted that in the circumstances, it was not required to adduce any evidence to counter the ground of opposition that succeeded before the Delegate or any other ground of opposition.Recently, in European Community v Commissioner of Patents [2006] FCA 706 , Young J dealt with a similar submission made in similar forensic circumstances.Young J accepted the submission and held that the appeal should be allowed and that the application for the patent should proceed to grant.His Honour referred to Caroma Sales Pty Ltd v Philmac Pty Ltd (1972) 46 ALJR 324 per Walsh J; Brickwood Holdings Pty Ltd v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [1983] 2 VR 587 at 588-589 per King J; and Titan Mining &amp; Engineering Pty Ltd v Arnall's Engineering Pty Ltd (1988) 12 NSWLR 73 at 75-76 per McLelland J.I have read those authorities, but will not review them.They support the following propositions: on the hearing of an appeal under s 60 of the Act (the precursor provision, with which the cases to which Young J referred were concerned, was s 60 of the Patents Act 1952 ), the only evidence to be taken into consideration is that adduced on that hearing; &#8226; the applicant is not obliged to put into evidence the evidentiary material that was before the Commissioner or other evidence, going to the merits of the appeal or going to actual or potential grounds of opposition; &#8226; where, as in the present case, the opponent has withdrawn and the Commissioner has indicated on the hearing of the appeal that she does not wish to take any active part in the proceeding, and there is no evidence before the Court capable of supporting any actual or potential ground of opposition, there is no basis on which the Court can uphold any ground of opposition.It is important to note that in the light of the history of the application, and, in particular, the Commissioner's acceptance of the application and the complete specification, s 61 of the Act would have obliged the Commissioner to grant the Patent if there had been no opposition to the grant.In substance, that is now the position on the appeal.The appeal should be allowed, the Commissioner's decision allowing the opposition should be reversed, and the Patent application should proceed to grant.Notwithstanding his submission that it was not incumbent on Cadbury to lead any evidence addressing any ground of opposition, in order to provide some "comfort" to the Court, Mr Burley, of counsel for Cadbury, did read an affidavit of Michael Kenneth Payne of the British Library Document Supply Centre, demonstrating that document D10 was in fact received by the British Library Document Supply Centre on 3 August 1998 --- well after the priority date.The making of the orders foreshadowed above will not, of course, foreclose the question of the validity of the Patent in any future proceeding, such as a proceeding for revocation of the Patent.</doc>

used for the prevention of infection caused by Human Papillomavirus ("HPV").More particularly, they are vaccines which are administered to prevent certain types of cancer.The background facts GARDASIL is the world's first cervical cancer vaccine.It is, at present, the only such vaccine approved in Australia.It prevents cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers and diseases caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.It was developed following collaboration between CSL and Professor Ian Frazer, who is well-known for his groundbreaking research in this area, and was named Australian of the Year in 2006.The vaccine has achieved widespread recognition.In 1995, CSL granted an exclusive worldwide licence of its proprietary technology to Merck &amp; Co., Inc. which conducted substantial research leading to the development of GARDASIL.On 14 December 2005, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd lodged an application with the Therapeutic Goods Authority ("the TGA") for marketing approval for GARDASIL.On 16 June 2006, the TGA granted that approval.The TGA also granted CSL approval to use what is described as the "GARDASIL Product Information Sheet", a document containing technical information regarding the nature and effect of the vaccine.The Product Information Sheet describes GARDASIL as a recombinant, quadrivalent vaccine: The quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Virus-Like Particle vaccine (HPV VLP vaccine) is a sterile liquid suspension prepared from the highly purified virus-like particles (VLPs) of the recombinant major capsid  protein of HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18.The L1 proteins are produced by separate fermentations in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae CANADE 3C-5 (Strain 1895) and self-assembled into VLPs.The VLPs for each type are purified and adsorbed on aluminum-containing adjuvant (amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate).The quadrivalent HPV VLP vaccine is prepared by combining the adsorbed VLPs of each HPV type, the aluminum-containing adjuvant formulation, and a buffer.GARDASIL is a sterile preparation for intramuscular administration.Each 0.5-mL dose contains approximately 20 mcg of HPV 6 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 11 L1 protein, 40 mcg of HPV 16 L1 protein, and 20 mcg of HPV 18 L1 protein.Each 0.5-mL dose of the vaccine contains approximately 225 mcg of aluminum (as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant), 9.56 mg of sodium chloride, 0.78 mg of L-histidine, 50 mcg of polysorbate 80, 35 mcg of sodium borate, and water for injection.The product does not contain a preservative or antibiotics.GARDASIL is "indicated" in females aged 9 to 26 years for the prevention of cervical, vulvar, and vaginal cancer, precancerous or dysplastic lesions, genital warts, and infection caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 (which are included in the vaccine).It is also indicated in males aged 9 to 15 years for the prevention of infection caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.It is administered intramuscularly in three separate doses over a period of some months, and a subsequent booster is required some years later.By an agreement effective on 1 May 2006, Merck &amp; Co., Inc. appointed CSL as its exclusive distributor of GARDASIL in Australia.CSL launched GARDASIL officially on 28 August 2006.The launch was accompanied by substantial marketing activity which included advertising in medical journals, mail-outs to healthcare practitioners, media releases and conference presentations.The evidence is that the market in Australia for a vaccine of this nature is substantial.In or about March 2006, GSKA applied to the TGA for approval to market its vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer.However, to date that vaccine, CERVARIX, has not been approved by the TGA for any indication.It appears that marketing approval is not imminent, but GSKA's application is likely to be reviewed "within the first half of 2007".It is necessary to say something briefly about HPV and cervical cancer.It is common ground between the parties that HPV is both a common and contagious virus which is usually transmitted by sexual contact and is a cause of, amongst other things, cervical cancer in women.Approximately 75 per cent of the adult population, male and female, will be infected by HPV at some stage during their lifetime.In most cases, the human immune system will eliminate the infection.However, if it persists over time, it has the potential to cause precancerous cervical lesions and ultimately cervical cancer.Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide.In Australia it accounts for some 230 deaths and 800 new cases per year notwithstanding Papanicolaou  smear screening programs.HPV is also said to be responsible for less common cancers, including up to 50 per cent of cases of vulvar cancer and 60 to 65 per cent of vaginal cancer, as well as approximately 90 per cent of cases of genital warts.There are more than 100 strains of HPV.Several of those cause cervical cancer or precancerous lesions.The strains of HPV principally implicated in cervical cancer are HPV types 16 and 18.These types are responsible for approximately 70 per cent of all cervical cancer in women worldwide.HPV types 31 and 45 are also associated with cervical cancer.HPV types 6 and 11 are responsible for 90 per cent of cases of genital warts.Pharmaceutical products, including vaccines, may not be imported into, manufactured or supplied in Australia unless they have been entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods ("the ARTG").An application for regulatory approval must include a dossier of chemical, pre-clinical and clinical data relating to the production, safety and efficacy of the product.This data is reviewed by the TGA and the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee ("the ADEC").That review determines the proposed "indications" for use.In order to gain marketing approval a product information sheet, which defines the indications for the pharmaceutical product, must also be approved.Section 21B of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989  prohibits a person from representing that therapeutic goods that are not included in the ARTG are so included.Although CSL at one point alleged that GSKA had contravened this provision, it did not rely upon any such contention in support of its application for interlocutory relief.The GSKA Information Sheet In June and July 2006, GSKA engaged in what it described as a "market research project".That activity, which was undertaken by a market research organisation known as Australian Fieldwork Solutions, consisted of contacting general practitioners by telephone to ascertain whether they were interested in participating, for a fee, in market research on cervical cancer vaccines, and if so sending by facsimile an information sheet containing comparative information on GARDASIL and CERVARIX ("the GSKA Information Sheet").Subsequently the general practitioner would again be contacted by telephone, and interviewed.The GSKA Information Sheet was a two page document containing some background information describing the impact and cause of cervical cancer, and particularly its links with HPV.It emphasised the importance of regular pap smears as early detection tools, and the need for regular screening.None of this was in any way contentious.However, the GSKA Information Sheet went on to deal, in a comparative way, with GARDASIL and CERVARIX.It stated that there were two companies developing a vaccine that would offer protection against HPV types 16 and 18 -- the two key cervical cancer causing types.It said that women would be able to choose which of the two vaccines they preferred.It observed that it was anticipated that the government would fund a free vaccination program for girls at school while for other women there would be two vaccines available from their general practitioner to be paid for privately, each costing around $400 per course of three injections.It added that both vaccines were expected to give at least 10 years protection before any boosters were required.It is necessary to set out in detail the nature of the comparative information provided in the GSKA Information Sheet: Vaccine A --- Gardasil Will be launched first to market later this year.This vaccine is based on work by Professor Ian Frazer, Australian of the Year.This vaccine is manufactured by CSL, a well established Australian company.This vaccine is indicated for females aged 9 - 26 years.Gardasil offers protection against cervical cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18 (These two HPV types cause 70% of cervical cancers).Gardasil is the only vaccine to provide protection against two further non cervical cancer causing HPV types responsible for genital warts.Gardasil may offer further protection against some vaginal and vulval cancers (Caused by HPV types 16 and 18).Gardasil has been formulated with an aluminium adjuvant.This adjuvant has been used in the formulation of many vaccines and has been proven to be effective and well tolerated.Research has demonstrated that Gardasil formulated with an aluminium adjuvant produces a long lasting immune response in women aged 9-26 years.Clinical trials demonstrate that Gardasil is well tolerated.Gardasil administration results in general symptoms which were comparable to the control group.The most common reactions observed after vaccine administration were injection site reactions including pain, redness, swelling and fatigue.Gardasil will be available as a single dose vial and a retractable pre-filled syringe.Vaccine B --- Cervarix Will be launched second to the market after Gardasil.The vaccine is based on work by Professor Frazer, one of several researchers who developed the vaccine technology.This vaccine is manufactured by Australia's leading supplier of vaccines --- GlaxoSmithKline.Indicated for females from 10 - 55 years.Cervarix offers protection against cervical cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18 (These two HPV types cause 70% of cervical cancers).Cervarix is the only vaccine to have shown evidence of additional cervical cancer coverage due to protection against two other cancer-causing HPV type infections (HPV 31 and 45) (Harper et al, 2006).Due to the protection against these 2 additional strains of HPV, Cervarix could potentially increase protection against cervical cancer from 70% to protecting against 80% of all cervical cancers (Munoz et al 2004).Cervarix has been formulated using next generation vaccine technology (adjuvant AS04), to generate a strong and sustained immune response in all women aged 10-55 years (Giannini, 2005, Schwarz, 2006 and Dubin, 2005).Research has demonstrated that the AS04 adjuvant induces a stronger immune response than the same vaccine formulated in the traditional way with an aluminium adjuvant (Giannini, 2005).The safety of the AS04 adjuvant has been demonstrated in studies involving over 30,000 people worldwide receiving at least one dose of an AS04 containing vaccine.Clinical trials demonstrate that Cervarix TM is well tolerated.Cervarix administration results in general symptoms which were comparable to the control group.The most common reactions observed after vaccine administration were injection site reactions including pain, redness, swelling and fatigue.Cervarix will be available as a single dose vial and a pre-filled syringe.Ongoing clinical trials are underway involving more than 30,000 women worldwide which will provide further data on the safety of Cervarix.It is also necessary to set out the preface to the GSKA Information Sheet: Please note that the following information about the vaccines to prevent cervical cancer does not represent an official statement by any company.It also does not provide a full or final representation relating to these vaccines and their features.This is, however, all true and accurate information.CSL's claims CSL claims that, when read as a whole, the GSKA Information Sheet makes a selective and incomplete comparison between GARDASIL and CERVARIX so as to present an inaccurate and unfair profile of its product.CSL further claims that those general practitioners who received the GSKA Information Sheet would understand it to be saying that CERVARIX was a superior vaccine to GARDASIL because it offered greater benefits.The evidence is that the GSKA Information Sheet was distributed to at least 300 general practitioners.There is also evidence that some time after these information sheets were provided, the general practitioners were interviewed by telephone.They were asked whether, on the basis of the GSKA Information Sheet provided, they would be prepared to prescribe one vaccine in preference to the other, and what price differential they would be prepared to pay in order to secure the benefits that one vaccine offered over the other.CSL claims that the questions were "loaded" in such a way as to suggest that CERVARIX offered clinical benefits that GARDASIL did not.In particular, CSL contends that the information sheet in combination with the loaded interview would be likely to have left general practitioners with the impression that CERVARIX provided a longer period of protection than GARDASIL, and that it provided what CSL described as "cross-protection".CSL also complains that the general practitioners were not told that GARDASIL had been approved for the vaccination of males aged 9 to 15 years, a feature that CERVARIX did not share.More specifically, CSL pleads in paragraph 10 of its Statement of Claim that GSKA, in the GSKA Information Sheet, and in the course of the telephone interviews conducted after the information sheet had been sent out, made the following representations in trade or commerce, in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 : the Information Sheet was prepared independently of the Respondent; CERVARIX is registered under the TG Act; CERVARIX has been approved by the TGA for sale and supply in Australia; CERVARIX is indicated for females aged ten to fifty-five years; CERVARIX has been approved by the TGA for protection against cervical cancer caused by HPV types 16 and 18; CERVARIX has been proven to provide protection against cancer caused by HPV type infections 31 and 45; CERVARIX is the only vaccine to have shown evidence of cervical cancer coverage additional to HPV type 16 and 18 infections due to protection against two other cancer causing HPV infections being types HPV 31 and HPV 45.CERVARIX can increase protection against cervical cancer from 70% to 80% of all cervical cancers.CERVARIX, formulated with an AS04 adjuvant, induces longer lasting and stronger immune responses than GARDASIL, formulated with an aluminium adjuvant.GARDASIL may offer further protection against some vaginal and vulval cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18.GARDASIL has not been approved by the TGA for the prevention of infection caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 in males aged nine to fifteen years.PARTICULARS The representations referred to in paragraphs  to  were expressly stated in the Information Sheet or by the Respondent's agents when interviewing the general practitioners or were implied from the Information Sheet and the statements made and the nature of the inquiries conducted by the Respondent's agents when conducting the general practitioner interviews.CSL pleads in paragraph 11 of its Statement of Claim that each of the representations set out in paragraph 10 was untrue in that: the Information Sheet was prepared by, or with the sponsorship, authority and approval of, the Respondent.CERVARIX is not registered under the TG Act; the TGA has not approved CERVARIX for sale and supply in Australia; CERVARIX is not registered under the TG Act and the TGA has not approved CERVARIX for any indications in Australia; CERVARIX is not registered under the TG Act and the TGA has not approved CERVARIX for any indications in Australia; there is no or insufficient evidence that CERVARIX provides protection against cancer caused by HPV infections types 31 and 45; there is no or insufficient evidence that CERVARIX provides protection against cancer causing HPV infections types HPV 31 and 45 and, further, CERVARIX is not the only vaccine to have shown evidence of potential cross-protection against other cancer causing HPV types such as HPV 31 and 45; there is no or insufficient evidence to claim that CERVARIX will provide up to 80% protection against all cervical cancers; there is no or insufficient evidence to show that CERVARIX, formulated with adjuvant AS04, induces longer lasting and stronger immune responses than GARDASIL, formulated with its aluminium adjuvant; as stated in the Product Information Sheet, GARDASIL has been approved by the TGA as indicated for the prevention of vulval and vaginal cancers; and GARDASIL has been approved by the TGA for use in boys aged 9-15 years as stated in the Product Information Sheet approved by the TGA.GSKA's proffered undertakings GSKA has offered undertakings that until trial, or order of the Court, it will not make any representation in Australia in trade or commerce that: CERVARIX is registered under the Therapeutic Goods Act ; andCERVARIX has been approved by the TGA for sale and supply in Australia, unless or until CERVARIX is approved by the TGA and/or registered under the Therapeutic Goods Act .GSKA has also offered to undertake that until trial, or order of the Court, it will not further distribute the GSKA Information Sheet.The effect of these undertakings is, as CSL acknowledged, to obviate the need to consider the representations pleaded in paragraphs 10,  and  of the Statement of Claim.However, there remains an issue as to whether there is a serious question to be tried with regard to the misleading or deceptive nature of the representations pleaded in paragraphs 10, , , , , ,  and .Is there a serious question to be tried?Representation 10 CSL contends that the preface to the GSKA Information Sheet (set out at [ 22 ] above) contains a representation that the information sheet was independently prepared, and that it represented a balanced, objective account of the features of the two vaccines.CSL further contends that the information sheet failed to disclose GSKA's involvement in its preparation.To the extent that it asserted that it did "not represent an official statement by any company", but contained "all true and accurate information" it implied that it was not GSKA's document.That representation, CSL contends, was false.GSKA contends that there is no serious question to be tried in relation to representation 10.It denies that any representation of the kind pleaded was made.I am prepared to accept that there is a serious question to be tried in relation to this representation.However, I think it unlikely that any general practitioner, who read the GSKA Information Sheet with care, would conclude that it was independently prepared, rather than being prepared by or on behalf of GSKA.The GSKA Information Sheet must be read as a whole, and against the background of it having been provided in response to an approach by a market research organisation that was prepared to pay general practitioners a fee for reading it, and participating in an interview.This had all the hallmarks of an advertising exercise, and the comparison drawn in favour of CERVARIX made it likely that the information sheet was part of that exercise.Representation 10 CSL contends that the representation that CERVARIX is "indicated for females from 10-55 years", which appears in the GSKA Information Sheet was false.It argues that the term "indicated" has a special meaning in relation to pharmaceutical products, suggesting that any product to which it applies has received TGA approval.It submits that general practitioners would understand the term in that way.GSKA submits that the term "indicates" has a broader meaning, and is not to be understood as suggesting that a product has TGA approval.GSKA refers to the medical dictionary definition of the term which encompasses this broader meaning, and suggests simply that that product is apt for the particular use.I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether the particular representation pleaded is contained in the GSKA Information Sheet.I am also satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried as to whether that representation is false.Representations 10,  and  CSL contends that these three representations, taken together, imply that CERVARIX is the only vaccine which has been proven to provide protection against cancer caused by HPV type infections 31 and 45.It notes that the GSKA Information Sheet states that CERVARIX is the only vaccine to have shown evidence of additional cervical cancer coverage due to protection against two other cancer-causing HPV type infections (HPV 31 and 45).The GSKA Information Sheet goes on to say that due to the protection against these two additional strains of HPV, CERVARIX could potentially increase protection against cervical cancer from 70 per cent to 80 per cent of all cervical cancers.CSL argues that the GSKA Information Sheet conveys three things: CERVARIX has been shown by reliable evidence to provide protection against not only HPV type 16 and 18 infections, but also HPV type 31 and 45 infections;CERVARIX is the only vaccine to have been shown by reliable evidence to provide such "additional" protection; andbecause CERVARIX provides such additional protection, it offers protection against 80 per cent of all cervical cancers.CSL submits that the representations pleaded suggest that the "evidence" of this additional coverage was generated in a robust scientific clinical study.The inclusion of the academic reference "Harper et al, 2006" is intended to reinforce that claim.However, CSL contends that there is no proper scientific basis for these representations.It says that GSKA's methodology for measuring the efficacy of its vaccine overlooks the role that the human body's immune system plays in the self-elimination of the HPV infection.This is because 70 to 90 per cent of HPV infections are cleared spontaneously by the body's immune system within 36 months.HPV infection does not progress to cervical cancer unless the infection persists.Because most HPV infections are transient, a reduction in incident infection cannot be equated with additional cancer protection.Incident infection is therefore an inadequate endpoint against which to test HPV vaccine efficacy.CSL further contends that the Harper paper does not support the claim made in the GSKA Information Sheet.The argument is somewhat technical, and need not be addressed at this stage.Finally, CSL contends that GARDASIL has shown evidence of cross-protection against cervical cancers induced by HPV types 31 and 45.However, CSL, acting responsibly, has not made any claims in relation to these HPV strains because they require further assessment which must be based on disease endpoints.GSKA submits that the representations in question were true, or at least based upon sound scientific opinion.It relied upon expert evidence of its own to support that contention.In my view, there is a serious question to be tried as to whether representations 10,  and  are misleading or deceptive.The dispute between the scientists on this point cannot be resolved on an application for interlocutory relief in which no deponent was cross-examined, and no proper analysis of the scientific opinions expressed in the various affidavits filed was undertaken.That task must await the final hearing of this matter.Representation 10 CSL notes that the GSKA Information Sheet refers to GARDASIL as having been formulated with an aluminium adjuvant.CERVARIX, on the other hand, is described as having been formulated using "next generation vaccine technology (adjuvant AS04)" which "induces a stronger immune response than the same vaccine formulated in the traditional way with an aluminium way with an aluminium adjuvant".CSL comments that it is unusual for adjuvants to be discussed with general practitioners or referred to in promotional materials.The use of terms such as "next generation" in contrast to "traditional way" was calculated to leave doctors in no doubt as to the greater strength and longer lasting immune response of CERVARIX in comparison to GARDASIL.In addition, the GSKA Information Sheet refers to a study by "Giannini, 2005" in support of its claim regarding the superiority of its adjuvant.The plain implication of all this is said to be that CERVARIX provides longer protection than GARDASIL.CSL contends that the comparative statements regarding the adjuvants used in each product are misleading because the aluminium adjuvant used in GARDASIL is quite different to what is commonly regarded as the traditional aluminium adjuvant reported in the Giannini paper.Without going too deeply into scientific issues, CSL says that the adjuvant used in the Giannini study was aluminium hydroxide.GARDASIL, on the other hand, is said to use an amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate adjuvant.It is impossible, on an interlocutory application, to resolve a scientific dispute of this nature.It is sufficient simply to say that there are conflicting views about the accuracy of the representation contained in paragraph 10 of the Statement of Claim.That means there is a serious question to be tried regarding this issue.However, without further evidence, the Court is not in a position to determine how strong that serious question might be.Representation 10 CSL complains that the GSKA Information Sheet says that GARDASIL " may offer further protection against some vaginal and vulval cancers (Caused by HPV types 16 and 18)" (emphasis added).It refers to the GARDASIL Product Information Sheet, which contained TGA approval of the statement that GARDASIL was indicated in females aged 9 to 26 years for the prevention of vulvar and vaginal cancer caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.The clinical studies on which that indication was based established that GARDASIL was 100 per cent effective against HPV types 16 and 18 infections, and therefore the word "may" ought not to have been used in the GSKA Information Sheet.GSKA submits that CSL itself used the term "may" on its website in reference to the protection available against these infections.There is a serious question to be tried regarding this issue.Representation 10 CSL complains that the GSKA Information Sheet does not include any reference to the fact that GARDASIL is indicated in males aged 9 to 15 years for the prevention of HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.That fact is important both clinically and commercially because HPV infects both males and females.It is sexually transmitted and so vaccination protects males from infections and subsequent transmission to their sexual partners.Vaccination also protects males from genital warts, and some rarer cases of penile and anal cancers.In addition, there were no clinical trials published that could support CERVARIX being granted marketing approval for use to prevent HPV infection in boys.In substance, CSL contends that the GSKA Information Sheet, and the interviews conducted with the general practitioners were designed to establish the comparative attractiveness of CERVARIX over GARDASIL, and the price differential that doctors would be prepared to pay to secure the benefits of one vaccine over another.In that comparative context, CSL contends that it was misleading for GSKA to omit any reference to the fact that GARDASIL was indicated for use in boys.GSKA submits in reply that the evidence raises doubts as to whether vaccinating males would be as effective in preventing HPV infection as it is in females, and that it is not clear that male vaccination would reduce transmission of HPV infection from males to females.There must be some doubt as to whether GSKA, in preparing a comparative analysis of the two vaccines, was required to espouse a particular attribute of GARDASIL that CERVARIX may not possess.Nonetheless, I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried as to the misleading or deceptive nature of GSKA's omission in the GSKA Information Sheet.Are damages an adequate remedy?It is often said that where an interlocutory injunction is sought an applicant must prove that it is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy.In R Meagher, D Heydon and M Leeming, Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane's Equity Doctrines &amp; Remedies (2002, 4 th ed), the learned authors suggest (at [21-345]) that this requirement applies only where an interlocutory injunction is sought in the auxiliary jurisdiction of a court of equity, and not if the injunction is sought in the exclusive jurisdiction.It is further suggested that injunctions in the common law jurisdiction need not be saddled with this requirement.There has been some debate among commentators as to whether an applicant for an interlocutory injunction is required to establish not merely that there is a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience favours the grant of such relief, the two conditions that are universally accepted, but also that, without an injunction, he or she will suffer injury for which damages will not be adequate compensation.In other words, the question is whether an applicant must overcome three separate hurdles rather than two.The recent decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 clarifies this issue.Gleeson CJ and Crennan J (at [19]), after referring to various cases dealing with the grant of interlocutory injunctions in cases of defamation, formulated the general principles governing the grant of such relief in the following terms: in all applications for an interlocutory injunction, a court will ask whether the plaintiff has shown that there is a serious question to be tried as to the plaintiff's entitlement to relief, has shown that the plaintiff is likely to suffer injury for which damages will not be an adequate remedy, and has shown that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.In Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325, the likelihood of irreparable harm was regarded by Stone J as, indeed, a separate element that had to be established by an applicant for an interlocutory injunction.Her Honour cited the well-known passage from the judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia [1986] HCA 58 ; (1986) 161 CLR 148 (at 153) as support for that proposition.GSKA submitted that CSL had not shown that it would suffer injury for which damages would not be an adequate remedy if interlocutory relief were refused.It noted that the "market research project" for which the GSKA Information Sheet was prepared had been completed.CSL responded by noting that, although GSKA had proffered an undertaking not to further distribute the GSKA Information Sheet, it had not undertaken to cease "market research" per se in relation to CERVARIX.This meant that CSL had no protection against the risk that the representations contained in the GSKA Information Sheet would not be repeated in circumstances that were outside the "market research project".It also meant that unless an interlocutory injunction were granted, CSL would not be protected against representations designed to convey to general practitioners and other health professionals that CERVARIX is a superior vaccine to GARDASIL.CSL also relied upon evidence that GSKA was making damaging and, it was submitted, inaccurate comparisons regarding the two vaccines which did not form part of any "market research project".A number of medical practices around Australia had reported to CSL that GSKA was engaged in marketing CERVARIX by representing that it was more comprehensive in its coverage than GARDASIL, covering 80 per cent of cervical cancer while GARDASIL covered only 70 per cent, and that GARDASIL's indication for genital warts was "inconsequential".CSL claimed that GSKA representatives would, in all likelihood, approach tender coordinators for the respective State purchasing boards responsible for implementing any public immunisation scheme.It also claimed that GSKA had made it clear that it proposed to engage in a variety of pre-launch activities, as well as communications with the TGA.According to CSL this meant that there was an unacceptable risk that GSKA would continue to engage in direct comparisons between GARDASIL and CERVARIX which involved representations which were wrong and not supported by scientific evidence.CSL had requested GSKA to desist from the conduct in relation to which CSL complained.GSKA had refused to do so.GSKA, in its written submissions, did not deal directly with the issue of irreparable harm.It addressed that question more generally under the ambit of balance of convenience.Balance of convenience --- the evidence The evidence regarding balance of convenience comes essentially from two sources.On behalf of CSL, Dr John Anderson, its Director, Sales &amp; Marketing of its Pharmaceuticals Division swore two affidavits dated 11 September 2006 and 18 September 2006 respectively.In an affidavit sworn on 21 September 2006, David Herd, GSKA's Director, Regulatory Affairs and Health Outcomes &amp; Pricing responded to Dr Anderson's affidavits.Put simply, Dr Anderson claimed that the GSKA Information Sheet, and follow-up interviews, represented CERVARIX was superior to GARDASIL, and did so in a manner that was misleading or deceptive.He said that, based upon his experience of the conduct of genuine market research, and the numerous errors in the information distributed by GSKA, he considered that GSKA had attempted to create "fear, uncertainty and doubt" about GARDASIL in order to reduce market confidence in that product.He said that this was a well-known marketing tactic known as "FUD".Dr Anderson observed that as GARDASIL was the only vaccine currently approved by the TGA, it was the only vaccine that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee ("the PBAC") could presently assess for the proposed mass immunisation program for prevention of cervical cancer.He spoke of the potential size of the market for GARDASIL in Australia, and the maximum sales that might be realised if every eligible female and male received the full three course dosage at the full price.The figure equated to a staggering $1.2 billion.Dr Anderson noted that the PBAC was currently considering CSL's proposal to conduct annual national vaccination of 12 year old girls, and a catch-up program for girls and women aged 13 to 26 years.He said that he was concerned that if the conduct complained of was not stopped immediately, and steps taken to correct the misinformation previously put out by GSKA, that misinformation could be conveyed to members of the PBAC and influence its decision.He said the misleading information could also influence federal cabinet to delay funding of GARDASIL until CERVARIX became available if they believed GSKA's claims that CERVARIX might be a better vaccine.He said that he was also concerned that State and Territory decision-makers, with inadequate scientific knowledge or experience, might be influenced in relation to the assessment of tenders by the dissemination of such information.Dr Anderson said that it was highly likely that misinformation of this nature could spread rapidly within the medical community.He noted that the issue had also received substantial media coverage as a result of the GARDASIL launch activities and the high profile of Professor Frazer's work.He said that he believed that the only way the damage being suffered by CSL could be reduced is if GSKA were immediately restrained from repeating the representations that are the subject of this proceeding.In his second affidavit, Dr Anderson elaborated upon the short-term damage to CSL from GSKA's conduct.He pointed out that CSL's sales representatives were encountering difficulty in their dealings with general practitioners because they were being diverted from speaking about GARDASIL, and compelled to respond to the misleading claims made about CERVARIX.He gave some examples of this.Mr Herd replied by noting firstly that GSKA had, since March 2006, been engaged in dealing with the TGA in support of its application for registration of CERVARIX.He understood that that application would be reviewed at a meeting of the ADEC in the first half of 2007.Mr Herd said that he was responsible for developing GSKA's reimbursement strategy for submission to the PBAC.He rejected Dr Anderson's claim that the PBAC would be influenced by representations of the kind contained in the GSKA Information Sheet.He noted the PBAC was an independent body set up by statute, and that its members included medical practitioners and pharmacists.He referred to the PBAC's guidelines on preparation of submissions and said that it was well understood that the PBAC made its decisions independently of any external influences, and on the basis of scientific and medical data presented to it by applicants.He noted that it was recognised within the pharmaceutical industry that it was improper for pharmaceutical companies to approach individual members of the PBAC and its various sub-committees to seek to influence its decision making process with regard to specific applications.He said that GSKA was careful to ensure that it complied strictly with these guidelines when making any application to the PBAC.Mr Herd also challenged Dr Anderson's claims regarding the harm that CSL might suffer with regard to CSL's application for public funding of GARDASIL on the National Immunisation Program ("the NIP").He noted that funding was allocated to States and Territories to manage the implementation of that program, and that each State ran separate tenders through a specially appointed tender board to determine which vaccine should be selected for provision through the NIP.He said that the GSKA Information Sheet, and the representations contained therein would have no impact or affect on CSL's application for such funding.Mr Herd said that GSKA would itself suffer irreparable harm if interlocutory relief were granted to CSL.He emphasised the need for GSKA to be able to communicate with the TGA fully regarding CERVARIX while the review process was being conducted.He noted that if the TGA came to the view that there were significant clinical advantages offered by CERVARIX, compared to GARDASIL, GSKA would be inhibited in being able to communicate or otherwise discuss such matters.These would delay GSKA's ability to apply for public funding of CERVARIX through the NIP, and its ability to supply CERVARIX to that section of the Australian population for which the TGA might decide to indicate the product.In particular, if the data submitted by GSKA to the TGA were accepted, Australian women over 26 years of age would be denied the opportunity to obtain access to CERVARIX.GARDASIL would be unavailable to this section of the population as it was only indicated for women aged 9 to 26 years.Balance of convenience --- the contentions CSL contended that the harm that it would suffer if GSKA's conduct was not restrained fell into three categories.First, its marketing launch of GARDASIL is being, and would continue to be, substantially disrupted.GSKA's conduct was said to be diluting CSL's marketing advantage arising out of the "head start" it had achieved through being the first to market its unique vaccine.CSL claimed that it was being forced to divert its sales resources in order to correct the misinformation being disseminated by GSKA.Second, CSL would lose sales of GARDASIL that would otherwise be made as general practitioners put off their decision to prescribe vaccine until CERVARIX came onto the market.In that context it was important to remember that these products were vaccines, and not treatments for existing illnesses.According to CSL it would be impossible to tell whether sales which had been lost or postponed were lost or postponed as a result of GSKA's representations, or for other reasons.Third, there was a risk that tender coordinators, who would be responsible for very large orders if a public immunisation program were implemented, would be unfairly prejudiced against GARDASIL on the basis of inaccurate or incomplete information.CSL argued that the tender coordinators, their public servant assistants and the members of any purchasing boards would not be well placed to analyse detailed scientific submissions.Many of them may not even be medically qualified.According to CSL the damage that it would suffer from each of these types of harm would not be calculable.Such irreparable harm would be suffered even if the time between the hearing of this interlocutory application and the final trial were truncated.CSL noted that apart from the 300 or so general practitioners who had participated in the "market research project" there were approximately 18,000 general practitioners in Australia of whom 12,000 or so actively worked in clinical practice.Misinformation of the kind sought to be enjoined was likely to spread quickly within the medical community.CSL argued that there would be no harm to GSKA if it were restrained until trial from making any representation in Australia that CERVARIX offered or possessed cross-protection against cervical cancer, or that it was more effective and offered longer protection than GARDASIL.That was because until such time as the TGA approved the marketing of CERVARIX, GSKA could not sell or supply its product.In any event, GSKA was free to legitimately "market" CERVARIX in Australia.CSL sought only to restrain GSKA from unfairly and inaccurately comparing CERVARIX to GARDASIL.CSL expressly disavowed any intention of restraining GSKA from communicating with the TGA about CERVARIX in relation to matters that might arise during the prosecution of GSKA's application for marketing approval.GSKA noted that the undertakings sought by CSL, in place of those proffered by GSKA, were in far broader terms even than the interlocutory and final relief sought in CSL's application.GSKA noted that the "market research project" about which CSL complained had been completed by mid-July 2006.It submitted that it was highly unlikely that the GSKA Information Sheet had been retained, or disseminated by the general practitioners to whom it was provided.Moreover, GSKA had undertaken, until trial or further order, not to further distribute the GSKA Information Sheet.GSKA submitted that interlocutory relief should be refused by reason of delay.It noted that a period of 10 weeks had elapsed from the time that CSL first learned of the GSKA conduct of which it now complained until it commenced this proceeding.GSKA next submitted that it was an important factor when considering the balance of convenience that the trial of this matter could be heard within a very short time.In fact, the Court indicated that the application for final relief could be heard in mid-November 2006, a delay of less than two months.According to GSKA, the fact that a speedy trial could be held meant that there was less justification for the grant of interlocutory relief.GSKA further submitted that CSL had grossly overstated the damage that it claimed it would suffer if no interlocutory relief were granted.CSL's assertion that its sales force was "not able to function optimally or effectively" in the absence of injunctive relief was not supported by the evidence.Only a handful of CSL sales representatives engaged in promoting GARDASIL had had any contact with doctors who had spoken to GSKA representatives about CERVARIX.There was nothing to suggest that any irreparable harm had been done by anything said to any doctor by a GSKA representative.GSKA challenged CSL's contention that the members of the PBAC were likely to be swayed in their decision whether to recommend the inclusion of GARDASIL in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by a two page information sheet used in a telephone survey of general practitioners.The same was said to apply to members of the State tender bodies for the NIP.GSKA also noted that CSL had engaged in a massive marketing campaign in relation to GARDASIL.This included two separate mail-outs to almost 20,000 general practitioners in Australia, advertisements in various journals, presentations at conferences and press releases.It submitted that it was inconceivable that a publicity exercise of this magnitude could be irreparably harmed in the few weeks prior to the trial of this matter given the cessation of the conduct complained of, and the negligible evidence of short-term harm that CSL had provided.Finally, GSKA contended that it would suffer significant and irreparable harm if it were restrained from carrying out the preparatory work leading up to the marketing of CERVARIX pending the trial of this matter.It submitted that both CSL and GSKA engaged in extensive activities gearing up to the approval and launch of a new drug product.These included corresponding with various regulatory bodies, such as the TGA, the PBAC and various State tender bodies for immunisation programs, attending conferences and symposia, preparing for distribution post-approval educational material, and responding to inquiries from interested persons.GSKA noted that its application for registration for CERVARIX was currently before the TGA.Following the extensive publicity that had been given to GARDASIL since its launch, GSKA had received a number of queries regarding CERVARIX.It had representatives attending three medical conferences in the period between mid-October and mid-November 2006.According to GSKA, if it were prevented from discussing the characteristics and attributes of CERVARIX it would be unable to: communicate with the TGA about its application for the registration of CERVARIX;participate in scientific debate or engage in meaningful discussions with attendees at any of the three upcoming medical conferences;communicate with the PBAC or State tender bodies; orrespond to queries from interested persons.GSKA submitted that its inability to do any of the above would severely hamper it in its preparation for the launch of CERVARIX in Australia and place it at a disadvantage to CSL in the Australian HPV vaccine market, over and above that which it already faced simply by being second to market.It submitted that CSL, by bringing this proceeding, was seeking to secure a monopoly in Australia for the supply and sale of GARDASIL to which it was not entitled by excluding GSKA from the relevant market for as long as possible.It submitted that in circumstances where it had proffered undertakings and agreed to a speedy trial and where there was no evidence of any real irreparable harm to CSL, the balance of convenience favoured the refusal of interlocutory relief.Conclusion The interlocutory relief sought by CSL is in the nature of a quia timet injunction.That is, what CSL seeks is an injunction to prevent or restrain an apprehended or threatened wrong which would result in substantial damage if committed.In quia timet proceedings, the court will have regard to the degree of probability of the apprehended injury, the degree of the seriousness of the injury, and the requirements of justice between the parties.In R v McFarlane; Ex parte O'Flannagan and O'Kelly [1923] HCA 39 ; (1923) 32 CLR 518 Isaacs J observed (at 539): The Court is not entitled to apply the obstacle of injunction to the contemplated action of a co-ordinate branch of the Government unless not only a clear case of illegality, proved to be calculated to result in a clear injury, is established, but also it is shown that by no other means can injury be averted or sufficiently compensated for.Dr I C F Spry, in Equitable Remedies (2001, 6 th ed), comments (at 378) that quia timet injunctions are not granted unless the imminence of the act to be prohibited is sufficiently clearly established to justify the court's intervention.The fact that there is no breach presently occurring may make it more difficult, as a matter of evidence, to establish that there is a sufficient risk of a future injury to justify the immediate grant of an injunction.If, in all the circumstances, the likelihood that an injury will take place is not sufficiently high, quia timet relief will be refused.The applicant will be left either to avail him or herself of such other remedies as may be open, or else to renew his or her application should the likelihood of an injury subsequently increase sufficiently to render equitable intervention appropriate.There is some debate as to whether a greater degree of proof is required in a case involving interlocutory quia timet relief than in a case involving a different kind of injunction.The issue is discussed in Meagher, Gummow &amp; Lehane (at [21-395]), and need not be further canvassed here.It is sufficient to note that, in many cases, it may be more difficult to prove that an apprehended injury will occur than it is to prove that an existing injury will continue.I have already indicated that I am satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried in relation to representations 10, , , , , ,  and  as pleaded in CSL's Statement of Claim.The allegations relating to some of those representations appear to me to be stronger than those relating to others.However, nothing of any consequence turns upon this for the purposes of this interlocutory application.I am prepared to proceed upon the basis that CSL will suffer some harm if these representations, assuming they are false, are repeated between now and mid-November, when the final hearing of this matter will take place.It may be, as CSL contends, that damages will not be an adequate remedy for such harm.That means that CSL has overcome the first two hurdles that it must meet in order to obtain the interlocutory relief that it seeks.However, CSL must still overcome the third hurdle, and demonstrate that the balance of convenience favours the grant of the injunction sought.It is common ground that CSL carries the onus on this issue.The real question in this proceeding, as in many similar cases, is where does the balance of convenience lie?In that regard, I am inclined to the view that each side has overstated its case in relation to this matter.CSL's evidence that its sales representatives are being diverted from extolling the virtues of GARDASIL to general practitioners by being forced to defend that product from GSKA's claims regarding CERVARIX seems to me to have been extremely tenuous.The fact that CERVARIX may be available for sale in 2007 would be likely, of itself, to raise questions in the minds of general practitioners about the respective merits of the two products.That is so irrespective of the representations contained in the GSKA Information Sheet.With regard to other impending harm, it seems to me to be improbable that GSKA's representations, as contained in its information sheet, would be likely to influence the deliberations of Federal Cabinet.The risk that the PBAC might be influenced by those representations is significantly reduced by the fact that CERVARIX will not be approved by the TGA this year.The PBAC is unlikely to make any final decisions regarding CERVARIX while TGA approval is still pending for that product.CSL's claims for final injunctive relief will have been determined long before the TGA has completed its review.GSKA's evidence as to the harm that it would suffer if it were temporarily restrained from repeating the representations that were made in its information sheet seems to me also to have been overstated.For one thing, CSL made it plain at the hearing, if it was not already clear, that it was not seeking to prevent GSKA from making whatever claims it wished to the TGA about CERVARIX, as part of GSKA's ongoing application for approval.That made some of the evidence upon which GSKA relied redundant.In addition, the fact that GSKA might be forced, for a relatively short period, to refrain from engaging in comparisons between GARDASIL and CERVARIX of the type contained in the GSKA Information Sheet hardly seems to me to have the serious consequences for GSKA, and its marketing plans, that Mr Herd foreshadowed.Although, I accept that damages would not be an adequate remedy if CSL were to succeed in establishing the various breaches of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act that it alleges, the same is probably true for GSKA in relation to the utility of any undertaking as to damages given by CSL.After weighing the evidence carefully, I am not persuaded that the balance of convenience favours the grant of interlocutory relief.I accept that the submissions on this issue are finely balanced.The fact that there will be a speedy trial and early resolution of CSL's claim for final relief seems to me to tilt the balance in favour of GSKA.If CSL's claim is accepted, GSKA will be enjoined from making representations of the kind impugned well before the TGA has completed its review of CERVARIX.That means that neither the PBAC, nor the State tender bodies are likely to be influenced by those representations.Any other harm that CSL might suffer between now and the trial is speculative, and not of sufficient gravity to warrant imposing restrictions upon GSKA's own marketing endeavours.That is particularly so given that any injunction would necessarily require GSKA, acting prudently, to adopt a conservative approach to what its many employees might say about its product, and effectively stymie legitimate competitive activity.Had it not been for the fact that there will be a speedy trial of this matter, which Stone J regarded as a relevant consideration in Hexal v Roche (at [78]), I might have been inclined to grant some, at least, of the orders sought by CSL.I will give the parties an opportunity to be heard in relation to the matter of costs.</doc>
<doc id="19317871" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19317871" title="Armenians in Italy">Armenians in ItalyArmenians in Italy covers the Armenians who live in Italy. There are currently 3.000 Armenians in Italy mainly residing in Milan, Rome and Venice; another main centre of Armenian culture and history is PaduaBesides the general population, there are monastic communities on the island of San Lazzaro (Venice) and at the Moorat-Raphael College of Venice as well as Armenian clergy at the Holy See (Vatican).History.The oldest information about Armenians living in Italy goes back to the 6th-8th centuries. Later, in the 9th-10th centuries, a great number of Armenians moved to Italy from Thrace and Macedonia. They were the descendants of Paulicians chased from Armenia by emperor Constantin.As to Armenian communities, they were formed in Italy in the 12th-13th centuries, when active trade was going on between Cilician Armenia and Italian big city-republics as Genoa, Venice and Pisa. Under Cilician Armenian king Levon II (1187–1219) (also known as King Leo II of Armenia), treaties were signed between the two parties, according to which Italian merchants had the right to open factories and to develop industrial activities in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and Armenian merchants could do the same in Italian towns. These treaties were periodically renewed, as long as the Cilician Armenian Kingdom existed. In the 13th century the number of Armenians in Italy increased because of the new wave of emigrants after the invasion of Tatars and Mongols.Beginning with the 15th-16th centuries the process of catholicizing Armenians was strengthened in Italy which greatly contributed to their assimilation with Italian people. Nevertheless, some Armenian organizations continued to function with the aim to preserve national identity. As a result first Armenian books were printed in Venice.Besides, in the beginning of the 18th century the Armenian Congregation of the Mechitarists (, also spelled Mekhitarists), was founded in Venice, on the St. Lazzaro Island (San Lazzaro degli Armeni). It exists up till now with its monastery, library, manuscripts depository and publishing house, and is considered as a centre of Armenian culture in Italy.There is also the reputable Moorat-Raphael College in Venice for general education with student body from Armenians from many countries and Collegio Armeno (The Pontifical Armenian College) in Rome for preparation of clergy in the Armenian Catholic Church.San Lazzaro Island.The Monastic Headquarters of the Mekhitarist Order is on the island of St. Lazarus in Venice (San Lazzaro Monastero Armeno in Italian). It is located on San Lazzaro degli Armeni, (Armenian: "Սուրբ Ղազարոս Կղզի", English: "Saint Lazarus Island"), a small island in the Venetian Lagoon, lying immediately west of the Lido; completely occupied by an Armenian Catholic monastery that is the mother-house of the Mekhitarist Order. It is considered as one of the world's foremost centers of Armenian culture.The beginnings of the island's Armenian history started when Mekhitar da Pietro and his seventeen monks built a monastery, restored the old church, and enlarged the island to its present 30,000 square metres, about four times its original area.Its founder's temperament and natural gifts for scholarly pursuits immediately set the Mekhitarist Order in the forefront of Oriental studies: the monastery published Armenian historical, philological and literary works and related material, renowned for their scholarship and accuracy as well as for the beauty of the editions, on its own multilingual presses.The island also houses a 150,000-volume library, as well as a museum with over 4,000 Armenian manuscripts and many Arab, Indian and Egyptian artifacts collected by the monks or received as gifts.The Mekhitarist Order also publishes the longest-running Armenian periodical, the academic "Pazmaveb".Collegio Armeno in Rome.Gregory XIII in 1584 had decreed the erection of a college for the Armenians (Bull "Romana Ecclesia"), but the plan fell through. When the Collegio Urbano of the Propaganda was founded later, there were always some places for Armenian students to study.Finally, in 1885, thanks to the generosity of some wealthy Armenians and of Leo XIII, the Collegio Armeno (The Pontifical Armenian College) was granted the Church of S. Nicola da Tolentino in the street of that name and the original wishes and decree of Gregory XIII relaized after so many years.The president of Collegio Armeno is an Armenian prelate; the students numbering from 20 to 25 study and attend lectures at the Collegio Urbano of the Propaganda, and wear red sashes and large-sleeved Oriental cloaks.Moorat Raphael College in Venice.Two wealthy Armenians from India, namely Mkertich Murat and Edward Raphael made donations to establish an Armenian college in Venice that was named Murat-Raphael College (Collegio Armeno Moorat Raphael) in honour of the donors.The property housing the college was the Palazzo Ca'Zenobio, built in prestigious Baroque style in 1690, and a subtle example of Venetian art and life in the 17th century, as testified by the beautiful Sala degli Specchi and Sala degli Stucchi. The college also maintained high academic level of education, reputable teaching staff, both clergy and laity, and the college had beautiful gardens. Moorat Raphael College has been closed recently, and the location serves as a motel, but occasionally art exhibitions, summer schools and workshops are organized to keep the special artistic atmosphere of the college.Cardinal Krikor Bedros Aghajanian and the Vatican.The Georgian-born Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian (Krikor Bedros Aghajanian () (September 18, 1895—May 16, 1971) was a leading prelate of the Armenian Catholic Church. He served as Patriarch Catholicos of Cilicia for Armenian Catholics from 1937 to 1962, and Prefect of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples) in the Roman Curia from 1958 to 1970. Agagianian was elevated to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII.Cardinal Agagianian was born in Akhaltsikhe (in modern Georgia), he studied at the seminary in Tbilisi and the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome. He was ordained as a priest on December 23, 1917. He entered the teaching Faculty of the Pontifical Armenian College in Rome in 1921; he became later the Rector of the same college from 1932 to 1937. Appointed Titular Bishop of "Comana" on July 11, 1935, he was elected Patriarch Catholicos of Cilicia of All Armenians by the Armenian Catholic Synod, on November 30, 1937, with the name of Gregory Peter XV. On February 18, 1946 he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Pius XII.During the 1958 papal conclave, following the death of Pius XII, Agagianian received a large number of votes, eventually approaching the majority needed for election. This was confirmed by the elected pope himself, Pope John XXIII. The newly elected pope John XXIII appointed Cardinal Agagianian to be a member of the leading body of the Second Vatican Council together with Cardinals Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius Döpfner and Giacomo Lercaro. Aghajanian was Pro-Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith from 1958 and full Prefect from July 18, 1960 to October 19, 1970. He died in Rome on May 16, 1971.Famous Italians of Armenian Origin.Among the most famous Armenian names in Italy in earlier centuries was Gjuro Baglivi (Giorgio Baglivi), whom the Enciclopedia Italiana (known as Treccani) holds to be "one of the most eminent men in the history of medicine". Baglivi was the name of a doctor of Lecce who adopted him as an orphan of a Julfa family. Other famous Italians of Armenian origin are the Venetian engineer Anton Sourian, the Venetian abbot and author Zaccaria Seriman, the poetess Vittoria Aganoor and the chemist Giacomo Luigi Ciamician.In spite of their small numbers, the Armenians in Italy have achieved notable successes in the country's cultural life. For example, often mentioned are the book and film critic Glauco Viazzi (Jusik Achrafian, 1921–1981), the art critic Eduardo Arslan (Yetwart, 1899–1968), the musician Angelo Ephrikian (1913–1982), the Arslan family of ear, nose, and throat specialists in Padua and Genoa, and Alessandro Megighian (1928–1981), former president of the European Academy of Gnathology. The first three were commemorated in a praiseworthy initiative from 1982 to 1984 in Venice, under the general title "Armenians in Italian culture."A prominent living writer and academic is Antonia Arslan, from Padua.A recently known famous Italian with Armenian ancestry is the showman Paolo Kessisoglu (1969), whose grandfather, born "Keshishian", moved from Anatolia to Genoa at the beginning of 20th century fearing aggressions in Turkey (though having already changed his surname to a more "Turkish version").Gevorg Petrosyan is a famous Armenian kickboxer and muay thai fighter living in Italy and fighting out of Satori Gladiatorium in Gorizia, Italy.Community.In 2000, the issue of Recognition of the Armenian Genocide was floored as a bill in the Italian Parliament that went on to recognize the Armenian Genocide. A memorial dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide was inaugurated in 2006 in the center of Rome.Religion.Besides the San Lazzaro degli Armeni, Italy has a number of very important churches and religious establishments.Also operating are the Levonian Monastery and the Armenian Immaculate Conception Order.</doc>
<doc id="19226737" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19226737" title="Santa J. Ono">Santa J. OnoSanta Jeremy Ono (born November 23, 1962) is a Canadian-American biologist and university administrator. He is currently the 28th President of the University of Cincinnati, effective October 23, 2012, following a brief stint as Interim President. He is the first Asian-American president of that university and in the state of Ohio. Previously, Ono served as the University Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs from June 2010.Biography.Born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he was educated at Towson High School, the University of Chicago, McGill University, and Harvard University. At Harvard he was a postdoctoral fellow supported by the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation. He has made key contributions to the field of gene regulation in the immune system and to the understanding of inflammation in the eye. Ono was raised primarily in Lutherville-Timonium, Maryland. He graduated with a BA in Biological Science from University of Chicago and a PhD in Experimental Medicine (Dean's Honour List) from McGill University in Montreal.Scientific career.Ono completed his fellowship at Harvard and then held faculty positions at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University College London (UCL), and Emory University. He was GlaxoSmithKline Chair of Biomedical Science and Head of the Department of Immunology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and honorary staff member at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. From March 2006 until September 2008, he served as Vice Provost for Academic Initiatives and Deputy to the Provost at Emory University in Atlanta. He was promoted to Senior Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and Academic Affairs in September 2008 and also served as Professor of Ophthalmology, Medicine, Pediatrics and Biology. In September 2010, he became Senior Vice President and Provost for Academic Affairs at the University of Cincinnati.Professor Ono has studied on ocular surface inflammation and the immune basis of age-related macular degeneration. His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression. He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression. His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos. This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs. This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport. NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin. They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer.Using transgenic mouse technology, they also showed (concurrently and independently of Alfredo Fusco), that fusion proteins between HMGA2 and other C terminal peptides (following chromosomal translocation) can drive the development of lipomas and generate obese mice. Further contributions in the field include the mapping of the HMGA2 promoter/enhancer.More recently, his laboratory determined the role of beta-chemokines in mast cell-dependent inflammation in the ocular surface. The work showed that chemokines not only contribute to leukocyte recruitment, but can cooperate with other mast cell activation signals to trigger mast cell degranulation. Finally, his lab showed that certain autoantibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of AMD and other rapid onset retinal degenerative diseases and may constitute useful biomarkers for the screening for AMD and its progression.Administrative work.As an administrator, Ono served on admissions committees at Johns Hopkins University for the Program in Cell & Molecular Medicine and the Graduate Program in Immunology. He also participated in the selection of HHMI undergraduate research fellows and as a faculty member in the JHU Center for Talented Youth.At Harvard, he served as head of the Inflammation, Immunity and Transplantation Focus Group at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. There, he served on the Executive Committee of the Harvard Program in Immunology and on two NIH Training grants within ophthalmology (Ocular Immunology and Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases). He worked closely with the late President J. Wayne Streilein and COO Ken Trevett and others in developing a strategic plan for the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard and helped attract significant funding from entities such as the Markey Charitable Trust and the Fidelity Investments.Ono was then recruited to UCL to the Cumberlege Chair and then as GSK Professor. Major funding from the Wellcome Trust, Fight for Sight, and GSK supported the development of a new immunology division at the UCL-Institute of Ophthalmology which grew to 27 members. Administratively, he served on the university Finance Committee, the UCL Council (the university's Governing Body) and as Associate Dean. He served on the founding UCL working group on Race Equality, helping to both generate and monitor the impact of a new race equality policy on the diversification of the UCL workforce. This was flagged as an exemplar policy by the UK government in 2005. He also worked with the Provost and Chief Development Officer and officials such as Mayor Junichi Seki of Osaka to forge links with Osaka University and Osaka City University, and partnered with the International Office to strengthen study abroad links with several universities, including Columbia University. The international efforts also led to the establishment of a network of prominent alumni/supporters of UCL to lead development activities in different parts of the globe as part of the Campaign for UCL.At Emory University, he had oversight of student enrollment activities, certain aspects of academic affairs and other responsibilities related to initiatives within the university strategic plan. Ono was part of a team that helped launch the Emory Advantage financial aid program, resulting in a loan replacement grant for individuals with a household income of $50,000 and less and a loan cap grant for individuals with a household income less than $100,000 It was the first program to reach into the "middle class" to facilitate access to an Emory education. In 2008-2009, he organized a self-study of the Emory Undergraduate Experience (within the university's four undergraduate colleges) to generate a roadmap for future steps to enhance the experience Ono also helped launch a number of programs to enhance intellectual community at Emory, including the Luminaries Series (designed to bring experts to Emory to speak about their scholarship) and the Life of the Mind Series to highlight Emory's own faculty. He also helped organize Emory's new Academic Leadership Program and the Emory Arts Competition.In June 2010, he was named Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and University Provost at the University of Cincinnati. Ono has oversight of budgets, personnel, and planning in the university's 13 colleges across four campuses. The university enrolls 42,000 students and employs 5,800 faculty members and 16,436 employees. Its FY 2011 budget totals $1.6 billion (with an economic impact of $5.3 billion), including $443 million in sponsored research. He is leading the implementation of the University's strategic plan UC 2019 Phase I of the university's Academic Master Plan was released on April 11, 2011 Investments have been made to both merit-based and need-based scholarships, the university Honors Program, the Study Abroad Program and to enhance academic advising. A new research institute has been launched with an initial $50 million investment and an office has been created to position UC students and faculty for nationally competitive awards. In 2012 a new technology accelerator was launched to accelerate the commercialization of university technology In 2011 UC moved up 13 places in the US News ranking of Top National Universities and the university moved to be among the top 5 producers of Fulbright scholars. Ono also serves as co-chair of a taskforce working on the University of Cincinnati Foundation's Strategic Plan.Ono has also reached out to the public by giving talks at K-12 schools in the US and UK and to the general public at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. There he gave talks to K-12 students in the Student Education program and to adult audiences in the Talking Points Evening Lecture Series. He has also served as an invited panelist to discuss the Reith Lectures at Windsor Castle on BBC Radio 4.Thought Leadership.President Ono has written extensively on research and innovation, college rankings, healthcare, STEM education, diversity, social media and more.Honors and awards.Ono is the recipient of the Pharmacia International Award in Allergy Research (the top international prize awarded to inflammation researchers under the age of 40), a Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship, the American Diabetes Association Career Development Award, the Arthritis Foundation Investigator Award, a Lucille P.

<doc id="19226982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19226982" title="The Wits">The WitsThe Wits is a Caroline era stage play, a comedy by Sir William Davenant. It was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 19 January 1634; it was staged by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. It was first published in quarto by Richard Meighen in 1636. A number of critics have considered it "Davenant's most successful and influential comedy."Herbert was initially unhappy with "The Wits", particularly on account of its oaths and explicit language; the influential courtier Endymion Porter interceded with King Charles I to tolerate and allow the play, which then proved popular at Court. Davenant would eventually become an effective courtier himself; the 1636 edition contains Davenant's dedication of the play to Porter, and a commendatory poem by Thomas Carew."The Wits" has been seen as anticipating aspects of Restoration comedy, especially in its "strong, unsentimental, witty heroine" — "Lady Ample represents the Restoration ideal of a woman being the equal to a man in all respects."When Davenant became manager of the newly organized Duke's Company at the beginning of the Restoration era, one of the first plays he produced was "The Wits" (1661), with Thomas Betterton in the lead role. "The Wits" was republished in 1665, in an octavo volume that also included "The Platonick Lovers". In a revised form, "The Wits" was included in the edition of Davenant's collected works issued by Henry Herringman in 1673.Source.In plotting "The Wits", Davenant depended upon a play of the previous generation, Middleton and Rowley's "Wit at Several Weapons". The common story involved two male relatives, an older and a younger. The older fancies himself a "wit;" he controls the family fortune through the rules of primogeniture, and denies his younger relative any funds. The younger man, impoverished but truly clever, manipulates and cheats the other, until the older man has to concede that the younger has triumphed in a contest of wit, and allows him an income.Davenant's two brothers, the Elder Pallatine and the Younger Pallatine, are versions of Sir Perfidious Oldcraft and Wittypate Oldcraft in the Middleton/Rowley play. Both comedies also feature an old guardian who tries to arrange an undesirable marriage for the pretty young woman who is his ward; the old guardian must be fooled and outmaneuvered by the play's youngsters for a happy ending.Synopsis.The opening scene introduces the Younger Pallatine and his henchmen, Pert and Meager, two discharged soldiers. The overall plot is quickly delineated. To finance his planned con-games, Pallatine has to borrow money from Lucy, the girl he loves; she has traded in her small supply of jewellery for funds for Pallatine.The second scene shifts to the Elder Pallatine and his confederate Sir Morglay Thwack. Both are wealthy landowners from the north of England, who have developed an absurd plan; outfitting themselves in flashy clothes, they have come to London to live by their wits. They intend to pursue liaisons with women, and moreover to depend on those prospective lovers for income, like gigolos. They even have a division of labour: the Elder Pallatine will pursue the younger women, while the grey-haired Sir Morglay will concentrate on the widows. The Younger Pallatine reproves them over their intentions, but the two are deaf to him. And since the Elder Pallatine intends to live by his wits, he thinks his younger brother should do so too, telling him, "Never hereafter...Will I disburse for you again; never."Act II brings on the third group of characters, Lady Ample and her servants Engine and Ginet. The Lady is a young heiress who has been under the guardianship of Sir Tyrant Thrift — a guardianship that is scheduled to end the next day. Sir Tyrant has gone to find a husband for Lady Ample, to further his control over her; but the Lady has plans of her own. As his name indicates, Sir Tyrant is a skinflint who has allowed his ward and her servants meager upkeep; Lady Ample has surmounted this by allowing herself to be courted by rich men, and using their expensive presents of gems and other fine things to improve her standard of living. The Lady's cousin Lucy bursts in with distressing news. Lucy's aunt has learned of the money she gave to young Pallatine; assuming (incorrectly) that Lucy has surrendered her virginity to her lover, the aunt has tossed the girl out of her house. Ample is also offended at Lucy's conduct — but over the fact that Lucy has given money to a man, instead of the other way around.Given the would-be gigolos' plans, it is not surprising that the Elder Pallatine and Sir Morglay find their way to Lady Ample. Their attempts at courtship are offensively inept. The play's two sides are now drawn: Lady Ample and her followers, and young Pallatine and his, are united in the goal of humiliating the two self-styled wits and cheating them of their money.With the help of a complaisant constable and his night watch, the conspirators launch a series of tricks that victimise first the Elder Pallatine, then Sir Morglay, and finally Sir Tyrant Thrift; each man falls victim to his greed and folly. The Elder Pallatine is locked in a trunk for hours; Sir Morglay buys his freedom with his last hundred pounds; Sir Tyrant thinks he is arrested for sacrilege and robbing a church. In the end, the conspirators are rewarded with ample funds; the Elder Pallatine graciously concedes that his younger brother is his superior in wit, and endows him with one of his country estates. The Younger Pallatine and Lucy can now marry; and Lady Ample agrees to take the Elder Pallatine as her husband, as long as he acknowledges her superiority in cleverness.</doc>
<doc id="19227091" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19227091" title="Anti-Korean sentiment">Anti-Korean sentimentAnti-Korean sentiment, anti-Korea sentiment or Koreaphobia/Koryophobia involves hatred or dislike that is directed towards Korean people, culture or either of the two states (North Korea/South Korea) on the Korean peninsula.Origins.Anti-Korean sentiment is present in China, Taiwan and Japan, and stems from such issues as nationalism, politics, economic competition, cultural influences, and historical disputes.History.In China, it has only come to prominence recently, due to issues such as the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay; which have accumulated over other issues over the years.In Japan, modern dislike for Korea can be seen as a form of national rivalry; more recently this rivalry was heightened by events such as the 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted by both nations.Region-based Koreaphobia.China.Korea and China have historically maintained strong ties. As Korea was annexed by Imperial Japan in 1910, Korea became under Japanese influence. Chinese believe that some ethnic Koreans were in the Imperial Japanese Army which invaded China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Additionally, adding to this sentiment is that some Koreans were reported to be involved into the operation of the Burma-Siam Death Railway. The Chinese referred to Koreans as Er guizi ().From a psychological perspective, Chinese are seen as assuming Koreans to be part of a sinocentric East Asian regional order. As a part of this group, Koreans are assumed to be inherently friendly to China. Chinese also emphasize hierarchy within their sinocentric order, where China is at the top of the hierarchy. In contrast, Koreans reject the sinocentric East Asian regional order and emphasize equality in diplomatic relations in East Asia. This rejection leads to conflict of existential identities, threatening the very meaning of being Korean and Chinese.At the end of World War II, North Korea, aligned with the Soviet bloc, became friendly with the People's Republic of China, while the PRC and the Republic of Korea did not recognize each other. During the Korean War, when China was engaged in war with South Korea and its western allies, efforts through propaganda were placed to intimidate hatred against South Korea, named a "puppet state" of the United States at the time by the PRC government..From 1992 on, after South Korea's normalization of relations with China, relations with the People's Republic of China gradually improved. Within the Chinese population, Korean art and culture became popular from 2000 onwards. Amid improvements in relations however, there were also looming anti-South Korean sentiments involved in various disputes between the two countries.Taiwan.Within Taiwan, some existing animosity towards Koreans amongst Taiwanese may be present as a result of the rivalry between the two states in relation to baseball. Disputes between Taiwan and Korea in the international sport competition arose numerous times. In November 2010, Taiwanese citizens protested against the disqualification of a Taekwondo athlete at the 2010 Asian Games after a Filipino referee disqualified a Taiwanese fighter, calling for a boycott on South Korean goods.On 23 August 1992, South Korea's "Nordpolitik" (Northern diplomacy) have made it to establish a diplomatic ties with People's Republic of China after Soviet Union. This resulted in the change in the diplomatic relationship of South Korea with the Republic of China, since it replaced anti-communist foreign policy with an effort to improve relations with other surrounding countries in the sense of geopolitics, including the People's Republic of China, in order to pressure and appease North Korea that eases the political anxiety and softens military tension in the Korean Peninsula and enables the possibility of a peaceful reunification of Korea. As normalization begun, Roh transferred diplomatic recognition from the ROC and PRC, and confiscated the property of the ROC embassy, transferring it to the PRC.According to an official from the Korean trade office in Taipei, sales of Korean products are not very successful in Taiwan because "the Taiwanese felt very betrayed after Korea severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan and reestablished ties with China in 1992, because the people of Taiwan had seen Korea as an ally in the fight against Communism... Now because the two countries have similar export-oriented economies and focus on the same business sectors, the Taiwanese see Korea as a great rival, and think that losing to Korea would be the end of Taiwan."In June 2012, CEO of Foxconn Terry Gou stated that he had "great esteem for Japanese (businessmen), especially those who are able to disagree with you in person and not stab you in the back, unlike the "Gaoli bangzi" (a racial slur for Koreans)", sparking controversy.Japan.Historically, relations between Japan and Korea have been poor.During the Joseon Dynasty, Wokou pirate raids on Korean soil were frequent, and so there has been general discontent for either side for a long span of time as a result, which would eventually form the basis of hatred between the two sides. Such tensions built up further after the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910.During the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake, widespread damage occurred in a region with a significant Korean population, and much of the local Japanese overreacted to rumors which spread after the earthquake. Within the aftermath of the event, there was a common perception amongst groups of far-right Japanese that ethnic Koreans were poisoning wells, eventually setting off a killing rampage against Koreans, where Japanese would use the shibboleth of "ba bi bu be bo" (ばびぶべぼ) to distinguish ethnic Koreans from Japanese, as it was assumed that Koreans would be unable to pronounce the line correctly, instead as . All people who failed the test were killed, which caused many ethnic Chinese and Ryukyuans, also unable to correctly pronounce the shibboleth, to be indiscriminately killed in large numbers. Other shibboleths used were and ""gagigugego"" (がぎぐげご), where Japanese people pronounce initial "g" as and medial "g" as (such a distinction is dying out in recent years), whereas Koreans pronounce the two sounds as and respectively.Much of the anti-Korean sentiment present today however deal with contemporary attitudes. During the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Japanese and Korean supporters clashed with one another, while Japanese media reported the conduct of Korean spectators in a negative fashion. Both sides were also known to post racist messages against each other on online bulletins. There were also disputes regarding how the event was to be hosted, as a result of the rivalry between the two nations. The territorial dispute over Liancourt Rocks also fuels outrage within far-right groups. Manga Kenkanryu (often referred to as "Hating the Korean Wave") by Sharin Yamano discusses these issues while making many other arguments and claims against Korea.Zainichi Koreans in Japan are also publicly perceived to be a nuisance and are seen as likely to cause trouble and start riots, a view shared by former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara. A Zainichi organisation, Chongryon, is commonly accused of providing funding and material to North Korea and indoctrinating the Zainichi Korean population to actively hate Japan.Right-wing groups in Japan today still commonly target ethnic Koreans living within Japan. One such group, known as Zaitokukai, is organized be members on the internet, and is known to be responsible for leading street demonstrations against Korean schools.There is also much concern in Japan regarding North Korea and its nuclear and long-range missile capabilities, as a result of missile tests in 1993, 1998 and 2006 and an underground nuclear test in 2006. There are also controversies regarding North Korean abductions of Japanese, where Japanese citizens were abducted by North Korean agents between 1977 and 1983.The Korean wave, or the exportation of South Korean pop culture, has created some resentment among pockets of Japanese society. Many Japanese citizens with conservative views and some of right wing nationalist groups have organized anti-Korean wave demonstrations via 2channel. On 9 August 2011, more than 2,000 protesters demonstrated in front of Fuji TV's headquarters in Odaiba, Tokyo against the broadcasting of Korean dramas. Earlier, in July 2011, well-known actor Sousuke Takaoka was fired from his agency, Stardust Promotion, for tweeting against the influx of Korean soaps. The general perception of Koreans on 2channel is negative, and board members often reference stereotypes of Koreans, such as the use of dogs in Korean cuisine.There are some efforts to create mutual understanding and friendship between people in two countries from dialogue, cultural exchange, and education.Mongolia.Some South Korean men take sex tourism trips to Mongolia, often as clients of South Korean-run businesses in Mongolia, has also sparked anti-Korean sentiment among Mongolians, and is said to be responsible for the increasing number of assaults on South Korean nationals in the country.Philippines.The participation of conscripted Korean soldiers serving under the Japanese Empire's flag in the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in the World War II has caused some Filipinos, especially those from the older generations, to associate the Koreans with atrocities committed during the war.In the recent years, there has been an increasing number of Koreans migrating to the Philippines. Although Koreans are generally welcomed to the country there has been some concerns. One concern is that many Korean migrants refuse to fully assimilate. Koreans continue to prefer to consume Korean products even if a local counterpart is available. It was reported that tour operators in Cebu doesn't benefit from Korean tourist because they are bared by Korean companies thus that only Korean travel agencies solely benefits from the tourist market. There has been complaints of rowdy behavior by Koreans in the country and Koreans are the number one violator of immigration laws according to the Philippine Bureau of Immigration.Former Soviet Union.During the era of the Soviet Union, ethnic Koreans in the Russian Far East were subject to deportations under the national delimitation policy, with the majority of Koreans relocating to Soviet republics in Central Asia.The deportation was preceded by a typical Soviet scenario of political repression: falsified trials of local party leaders accused of insurrection, accusations of plans of the secession of the Far Eastern Krai, local party purges, and articles in "Pravda" about the Japanese espionage in the Far East.The resettlement plans were revived with new vigor in August 1937, ostensibly with the purpose of suppressing "the penetration of the Japanese espionage into the Far Eastern Krai". This time, however, the direction of resettlement was westward, to Soviet Central Asia. From September to October 1937, more than 172,000 of Soviet Koreans were deported from the border regions of the Russian Far East to Kazakh SSR and Uzbek SSR (the latter including Karakalpak ASSR).United States.The majority of resentment against Koreans in the United States and much of the western world is only in regards to North Korea, although there have also been minor historical incidents.During the Korean War, the United States fought a bloody war to assist South Korea from communist invasion. Since the war, the common knowledge of North Korea is that it is an oppressive state.Following heavy re-militarization and a series of missile tests, Americans were made to fear a possible attack by a "rogue state" such as North Korea. In United States President George W. Bush's State of the Union Address on January 29, 2002, he described North Korea as a part of the "Axis of evil". Following the Nuclear program of North Korea and subsequent 2006 North Korean nuclear test, the United States imposed UN sanctions on North Korea. These economic sanctions are very unlikely to be lifted by the United States due to North Korea's incompliance to the Six-party talk agreements.The Los Angeles riots of 1992 were partially based on Anti-Korean sentiment. Ice Cube's song "Black Korea" which would later be accused of inciting racism was written in response to the death of 15-year old African-American Latasha Harlins, who was shot and killed by Korean-American store owner Soon Ja Du on March 16, 1991, as well as the preponderance of Korean grocery stores in primarily black neighborhoods. The event resulted in mass ransacking and destruction of Korean-American owned stores in Los Angeles by groups of young African-Americans.Derogatory terms.There are a variety of derogatory terms referring to Korea. Many of these terms are viewed as racist. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Korean people as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.</doc>
<doc id="19227410" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19227410" title="Ovens &amp; King Football League">Ovens &amp; King Football LeagueHistory.The "Ovens & King Football League" was formed on the 13th of June 1903, after a handful of men met at The Bulls Head Hotel in Wangaratta to consider forming a football competition. One week later, the first matches of the Ovens & King Football Association were played. The competition changed its name to the Ovens and King Football League after the 1928 season.Today, more than 100 years later, teams from Benalla, Bright, Greta, Glenrowan, King Valley, Milawa, Moyhu, North Wangaratta, Tarrawingee and Whorouly participate in seniors, reserves and five netball grades.Located in the rich Ovens Valley and King Valley of northeast Victoria, the league has produced a number of elite football who have gone on to play in the AFL, including the cousins Nigel (Brisbane Lions) and Matthew Lappin (St Kilda/Carlton), ruckman Mark Porter (Kangaroos/Carlton) and most recently Michael Newton (Melbourne), Barry Hall St Kilda/Sydney/Western Bulldogs and Brendan Fevola Carlton and Brisbane Lions.Community support is strong in the Ovens and King districts with crowds attending games usually greater than most neighbouring competitions. The local football is an important social outlet for many local communities and finals matches draw especially strong crowd numbers.In 2010, the league added Tatong, Swanpool, Goorambat and Bonnie Doon, who had previously played in the now-defunct Benalla & District Football League. After four years of heavy losses, Swanpool and Tatong were thrown out of the competition by AFL County Victoria, ending nearly 100 years of tradition. A two-way merge proposed by the clubs was rejected, as was a transfer to the Picola District FL.2007 Ladder.FINALS 2008 Ladder.FINALS Note: Moyhu lost fifteen points in the First Semi-Final against Whorouly after a head count.2009 Ladder.FINALS 2010 Ladder.

<doc id="19275950" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19275950" title="One Nevada Credit Union">One Nevada Credit UnionOne Nevada Credit Union headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, is the largest locally-based federally insured, state-charted credit union in Nevada with locations in Las Vegas, Henderson, Reno, North Las Vegas and Pahrump. It operates several Credit Union Service Organizations (CUSOs) including: One Nevada Realty Services, LLC; One Nevada Insurance Services, LLC; One Nevada Investment Group and others.As of September 30, 2014, One Nevada had 16 branch locations, 400 surcharge free ATMs in Nevada alone and 46,000 worldwide as part of the Allpoint Network, 75,709 members, and $714 million in total assets. It is classified as a well-capitalized credit union by the National Credit Union Administration and its deposits are insured for up to $250,000 through the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. One Nevada remains one of the strongest credit unions or banks in the state with more than 10.9% in capital reserves.One Nevada has a community charter, meaning membership is available to anyone who lives, works (or regularly conducts business in), worships, attends school, or volunteers in Clark County, Washoe County, Nye County, along with members of the immediate family or household of an existing member or those eligible for membership.In 2014, One Nevada Credit Union was listed as the Las Vegas Review Journal's Best of Las Vegas #1 Bank/Credit Union by RJ readers.In 2014, One Nevada Credit Union was selected as one of the “Best Companies to Work For” by Nevada Business Magazine.In 2014, One Nevada Credit Union was listed on the Las Vegas Review Journal's Top Workplaces ranking No. 2 among mid-size companies.In 2013, One Nevada Credit Union was listed on the Las Vegas Review Journal's Top Workplaces ranking No. 3 among mid-size companies. Also in 2013, the credit union was also named one of the best places to work by the Southern Nevada Human Resources Association, placing #1 in the small business category.In 2011, One Nevada Credit Union was listed on Training Magazine's "Training Top 125" for the third straight year, ranking No. 108.In 2009, One Nevada was chosen as a Best Place to Work by the Society for Human Resource Management ranking No. 21 among medium-size companies with 251 to 999 employees.One Nevada was also chosen as 2009, 2011 and 2013 AARP Best Employers for Workers Over 50.History.One Nevada has its beginnings in two separate credit unions that merged many years later. The Vegas Air Base Federal Credit Union was started on February 10, 1950, when nine civilian employees pooled $5 each to begin their credit union. The credit union changed its name to Nellis Federal Credit Union in 1958.Meanwhile, at Las Vegas City Hall, seven City employees began the Las Vegas City Employees Federal Credit Union on February 14, 1951. For the next 30 years or so, both credit unions served the employees of their respective employers and their families. Both credit unions grew and expanded their services.On August 31, 1983, the Nellis Southern Nevada Federal Credit Union and the Las Vegas Federal Credit Union merged and adopted the name Nevada Federal Credit Union.During the 1980s, several smaller credit unions joined with Nevada Federal. Those smaller credit unions include the Showboat Credit Union, the Commercial Center Credit Union, the Nevada Air Guard Credit Union, the Washoe State Employees Federal Credit Union, the North Las Vegas City Employees Federal Credit Union, the Vegas Village Credit Union, the Tropicana Employees Federal Credit Union and others.In August 2011, the members of Nevada Federal Credit Union approved the conversion from a federal charter to a Nevada state-charter. The credit union changed its name to One Nevada Credit Union shortly thereafter.Products and services.In addition to traditional banking products and services such as share savings, share certificates, share drafts (checking), mortgage loans, auto loans, and credit cards, the credit union offers various non-traditional products. These include second chance (New Start) checking, first-time home buyer program and Essential Checking accounts for member-households who earn less than $35,000 annually or have recently had a job loss. As of March 2010, the credit union had also launched a suite of prepaid debit card products.One Nevada Credit Union is consistently among the largest mortgage lenders in Clark County, Nevada. The credit union recently participated in Nevada's Hardest Hit Fund and the HARP 2.0 mortgage assistance programs.Not-for-profit structure.One Nevada, like many U.S. credit unions, is locally controlled by a volunteer Board of Directors who represent the members interests. Unlike a traditional bank owned by public stockholders, a member election for the Board of Directors is held once a year. Any member in good standing can petition to run for the Board of Directors. Board volunteers are not paid for their time or service. The Board also appoints a volunteer Supervisory Committee. The Credit Union's income, aside from operating expenses and funding capitalization, are returned to the members in the form of lower loan rates, expanded services and normally, higher dividends on deposit accounts. Therefore, the credit union, like all others in the U.S., maintains a federal tax-exempt status because of the cooperative, not-for-profit organizational structure.</doc>
<doc id="19278017" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19278017" title="Law of Chile">Law of ChileThe legal system of Chile belongs to the Continental Law tradition.The basis for its public law is the 1980 Constitution, reformed in 1989 and 2005. According to it Chile is a "democratic republic". There is a clear separation of functions, between the President of the Republic, the Congress, the judiciary and a Constitutional Court. See Politics of Chile.On the other hand, private relationships are governed by the Chilean Civil Code, most of which has not been amended in 150 years. There are also several laws outside of the Code that deal with most of the business law.Public law.Constitution.The current Political Constitution of the Republic of Chile, approved by Chilean voters in a tightly controlled plebiscite on September 11, 1980 under Augusto Pinochet, and made effective on March 11, 1981, has been amended in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2005.In 2005 over 50 reforms were approved, which eliminated some of the remaining undemocratic areas of the text, such as the existence of non-elected Senators (appointed senators, or senators for life) and the inability of the President to remove the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. These reforms led the President to controversially declare Chile's transition to democracy as complete. There is a constitutional court ("Tribunal Constitucional") with the competence to declare a singular law "not applicable" to an individual case ("inaplicabilidad por inconstitucionalidad") and, having declared that at least once, the unconstitutionality of that law in general.Administrative law.The President of the Republic must fulfill the administrative function, in collaboration with several Ministries or other authorities with "ministerial rank". Each Ministry has one or more sub secretaries. The actual "satisfaction of public needs" is performed through public services, dependant or at least related to one of those sub secretaries.All Ministries and public services have a body of workers or administrative personnel ("funcionarios públicos").Public property is subject to privileges and burdens, because it serves public purposes. The sea, rivers and lakes, mines and natural reservations belong to the state and may be used by "anyone", but when individual exploitation is possible they it is in the hands of privates. On the other hand, buildings, cars and other supplies that are necessary for the work of public agencies are also property of the state.Public entities act through administrative procedures, that is, processes with formal stages where opportunities to deliver evidence and exercise appeals are granted to the citizens. The recent basic law of administrative procedures deals with most of the general matters pertaining the administrative procedures of all public entities.There is not a singular Administrative court to deal with actions against the administrative entities, but several specialized courts and procedures of review. However, civil courts have jurisdiction over all matter that are not in the scope of other tribunal, such as public liability and the overturn of single administrative acts.Regulation.Since the privatization of most economic activities in the 1980s, the President and the independent agencies became the main policy makers regarding the regulation of the economy, subordinated to legislation.The exploitation of mines and water resources is given in concession to private entrepreneurs.All activities that can have a significant impact on the environment must obtain an administrative authorization and are subject to heavy regulation by several different agencies.There are agencies ("Superintendencias") dealing with Electricity and Fuels, Water Supply and Treatment, Banking and Finance, Stock Exchange, Bankruptcy, Pensions and Retirement Funds, Health, Social Security, etc.Private law.Civil Code.The Civil Code of the Republic of Chile is the work of the Chilean-Venezuelan jurist and legislator Andrés Bello. After several years of individual work (though officially presented as the work of multiple Congress commissions), Congress passed the Civil Code into law on 14 December 1855, and came into force on 1 January 1857. The Code has kept in force since then though it has been the object of numerous alterations.The main modernisations the code has undergone have affected family law and the law of successions. On one hand, these reforms have introduced more equal relations between men and women and, on the other, they have eliminated discriminations between children born from married couples and those born extramaritally.Being part of the civil law tradition, there is no obedience to precedent in Chilean law. Nevertheless, sentences of a higher court can be appealed to the Supreme Court based in the "erroneous application of the law", thus being able to deliver uniform decisions in controversial matters of law." See Judiciary of Chile".Commerce.Though the Commerce Code of 1868 was the main source of business law, nowadays the legislation is widely spread in many legislative bodies.For instance, both the Civil Code and the Commerce Code deal with the basic matters of enterprises, but Corporations and limited liability enterprises have a statute of its own.Recently the law of bankruptcy has been incorporated in the Commerce Code, in a process of re-codification.Matters such as banking and the stock exchange are strongly regulated by government agencies and therefore are subject to public scrutiny. Recently, these agencies have fined important executives for insider trading [http://www.elclarin.cl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=10143&Itemid=47].Criminal Law.Since the year 2000, Chilean criminal procedure is experimenting one of the most important legal reforms of the country's history, completely replacing an inquisitory procedure by an accusatory system, very similar to the one in Germany or the United States. While the prosecution is in charge of an autonomous authority ("Ministerio Público"), the actual judgement is made by a collegiate court ("Tribunal de Juicio Oral en lo Penal"). Trials are public and verbal. However, the law grants several alternatives to the defendant so as to avoid the trial, but, at the same time, grant the victim's satisfaction and the public safety.The Chilean Criminal Code, which defines the conducts that constitute an offense and the applicable conviction, dates back to 1874. It was greatly inspired by the Spanish Code of 1848 and the Belgian Code of 1867. The Code has been widely criticized, and the Ministry of Justice is studying a complete replacement by the year 2010 [http://www.politicacriminal.cl/n_01/pdf_01/d_1.pdf].</doc>
<doc id="19278037" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19278037" title="Varnum v. Brien">Varnum v. BrienVarnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862 (Iowa 2009), was a unanimous decision of the Iowa Supreme Court dated April 3, 2009, that held the state's limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples violated the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution. It established same-sex marriage in Iowa. In 2007, a lower court had granted summary judgment in favor of six same-sex couples who sued Timothy Brien, Polk County Recorder, for refusing to grant them marriage licenses.In 2010 Iowa voters defeated the retention of three of the judges responsible for the decision, but in 2012 they retained the one judge who participated in the decision and whose term would otherwise have ended, following various polls showing that a majority of Iowans support marriage equality.Issue.Six same-sex couples went to the Office of the Polk County Recorder in Des Moines, Iowa, at various times between November 2005 and January 2006 in an attempt to apply for marriage licenses. Each couple's application was denied because in each case the couple was composed of two people of the same sex, and Iowa law only permitted couples composed of one man and one woman to marry. The couples filed suit in Polk County District Court, arguing that this law violated certain rights guaranteed by the Iowa constitution.District Court ruling.Judge Robert Hanson of Polk County District Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on August 30, 2007. He ruled that the marriage statute was unconstitutional, and that the Polk County Recorder was required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples who otherwise meet the requirements for marriage. Hanson's ruling states, in part, that:Judge Hanson issued a stay of his ruling on August 31, 2007, in anticipation of an appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court. One same-sex couple was able to obtain a marriage license in the brief time between Hanson's ruling and the stay.Iowa Supreme Court ruling.Polk County appealed Hanson's ruling to the Iowa Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on December 9, 2008. There were 24 amicus curiae briefs filed with the court. In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Mark S. Cady, the Court affirmed Hanson's decision on April 3, 2009.The Supreme Court initially stated its duty to protect the right of individuals:The Court noted that Iowa has a long history of progressive thought on civil rights. Seventeen years before the Dred Scott decision, the Iowa Supreme Court "refused to treat a human being as property to enforce a contract for slavery and held our laws must extend equal protection to persons of all races and conditions." Eighty-six years before "separate but equal" was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in "Brown v. Board of Education", the Iowa Supreme Court ruled such practices unconstitutional in Iowa. In 1869, Iowa was the first state in the union to admit women to the bar and allow them to practice law. Three years later the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the State of Illinois' decision to "deny" women admission to the bar.The Court stated that the equal protection clause of the Iowa Constitution requires that laws treat alike all those who are similarly situated with respect to the purposes of the law, and concluded that homosexual persons are similarly situated compared to heterosexual persons for purposes of Iowa's marriage laws. The Court applied the standard of review known as intermediate scrutiny to assess the government's objectives as described by the county: maintaining traditional marriage, promotion of an optimal environment to raise children, promotion of procreation, promotion of stability in opposite-sex relationships and conservation of resources. The Court concluded that:But the court noted the national development of gay rights in both "Lawrence v. Texas" and "Romer v. Evans", and it cited discussion in these cases as evidence of a history of discrimination against gays and lesbians. Because plaintiffs brought a state constitutional claim, the state Supreme Court was not constrained by federal precedents, and the decision was not subject to review by a federal court.On April 27, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court issued a procedendo directing the Iowa District Court for the County of Polk to "proceed in the manner required by law and consistent with the opinion of the court." The court's decision became effective with the issuance of the procedendo.Reaction.In a joint press release on April 3, Iowa House Speaker Pat Murphy and Senate majority leader Mike Gronstal welcomed the court's decision, saying "When all is said and done, we believe the only lasting question about today’s events will be why it took us so long. It is a tough question to answer because treating everyone fairly is really a matter of Iowa common sense and Iowa common decency. Iowa has always been a leader in the area of civil rights.” Iowa State Senator Matt McCoy, who is openly gay, welcomed the decision, calling it "a red letter day for the state of Iowa."The state Senate Republican leader, Paul McKinley, expressed disappointment and called for a constitutional amendment that "protects traditional marriage." Iowa Governor Chet Culver stated that he was "reluctant to support amending the Iowa Constitution to add a provision that our Supreme Court has said is unlawful and discriminatory."Critics contended that court rulings that grant same-sex couples the right to marry overstep the constitutional authority of the judicial branch, that such decisions should be left to more representative processes such as legislation and ballot-initiatives. Others contended that equal treatment under the law and due process with respect to denying same-sex couples the right to marry unequivocally deserved a response from the court. In declaring the DOMA statute an unconstitutional violation the Iowa's equal protection clause, the court referred to the constitutional provision declaring such statutes "void."Following the decision, groups opposed to same-sex marriage organized a campaign against Chief Justice Marsha Ternus, Justice David Baker, and Justice Michael Streit in their subsequent retention election, "with heavy support from out-of-state conservative and religious groups." All three were dismissed by Iowa voters on November 2, 2010, marking the first time an Iowa Supreme Court justice was not retained since the retention system was adopted for Iowa justices in 1962. In 2012, the three of them received Profile In Courage Awards from the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. In presenting the award, Caroline Kennedy said:In the November 6, 2012, election, voters retained Justice David Wiggins, the one judge who participated in "Varnum" whose retention was on the ballot, by a 54% to 46% margin.</doc>
<doc id="19266123" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19266123" title="John Doe (The X-Files)">John Doe (The X-Files)"John Doe" is the seventh episode of the ninth season of the American science fiction television series "The X-Files". The episode first aired in the United States on January 13, 2002 on the Fox network. It was written by executive producer Vince Gilligan, and directed by co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren. The episode is a "monster-of-the-week" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of "The X-Files". "John Doe" earned a Nielsen rating of 5.0 and was viewed by 5.28 million households. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics.The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett wakes up in Mexico with no memory of who he is or how he got there. Meanwhile, Reyes and Scully struggle to locate him. The two later discover that Doggett's memory has been taken by a "memory vampire" that runs a drug cartel."John Doe" was written after Gilligan had been thinking of a story involving a "memory vampire" for months. Furthermore, the episode was MacLaren's directorial debut. Noted director Kim Manners helped guide her through the process. Director of photography Bill Roe used specific lighting for the episode; indoor scenes are dark and hard to make out whereas outside scenes are bright and over-saturated with light. The Mexican hotel apartment was created from Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) old apartment set.Plot.John Doggett (Robert Patrick) awakens inside an abandoned warehouse to find a man in the process of stealing one of his shoes. Doggett chases the man outside, where he summons two Mexican police officers. One of the policemen hits the man with his nightstick, while the other demands his identification. When Doggett finds he has no papers, the officer asks him his name. Doggett is shocked to realize he can't remember his own identity.Doggett is taken to the local jail, where he meets a fellow prisoner named Domingo. Domingo is eventually freed and offers to have Doggett bailed out as well, under the condition that Doggett help him perform his criminal tasks. Doggett agrees, but changes his mind once he is released. Nestor, Domingo's friend, pulls a gun, but Doggett quickly overpowers him and takes the weapon. Doggett returns to the warehouse in hopes of finding clues to his identity. From time to time, he experiences flashbacks of his wife and son, but has no idea who they are.In the meantime, in Washington, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) examine video footage from a security camera positioned at the Mexican border. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh disbands the task force searching for Doggett, believing the video is proof that he entered Mexico on his own free will and was not abducted. Meanwhile, Doggett phones a United States Marine public affairs office, hoping his Marine tattoo will shed some light on his true identity. Before he is able to ask any questions, he notices policemen nearby and flees.Scully traces Doggett's phone call and has Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) travel to the Mexican town where he was last seen It is revealed that Caballero, the head of the local drug cartel, is a "memory vampire": he can absorb the memories of those posing a threat to his operation. Reyes finds Doggett and faces gunfire from the police, who are controlled by Caballero's cartel; all the while, Reyes attempts to remind Doggett of who they are. Doggett remembers his son. The agents are rescued by Skinner and the Mexican Federales. Doggett tearfully admits that he is happy to have all of his memories, even the bad ones, "as long as I remember the good.”Production.Writing and directing."John Doe" was written by executive producer Vince Gilligan and directed by Michelle MacLaren. The episode marked Gilligan's first solo episode for the ninth season. Gilligan had "fiddled" with the story of a "memory vampire" for months, before writing it. The notion to set the story in Mexico and center it around Robert Patrick's character was Frank Spotnitz's idea. From there the story "went together fairly easily.""John Doe" was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she had never helmed an episode before, MacLaren utilized information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing he said to me was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie in his head and really visualizes it." Gilligan later said that MacLaren "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow."Filming and effects.Director of photography Bill Roe later stated that he borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film "Traffic" for some of the shots. In addition, before filming, he decided to do various test shots to get the lighting right. The crew ended up shooting "exteriors three, four stops over what you should shoot it at", resulting in very washed out outdoor scenes. Roe and his crew had a hard time developing the various lighting contrasts for the episode. When talking about the episode, Roe said: "it was really dark so we had this huge contrast of lighting. It was dark and warm and brown. When you go inside, you can barely see things, but when you're outside, it's just blaring." To create the Mexican town featured in the episode, scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles. A matte of the town's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added. In addition, Mat Beck was given a flyer, and he duplicated it, making several strings of posters that did not exist when the shots were filmed.When creating the Mexican hotel apartment, the crew re-decorated what was once Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment on the show. Production Designer Corey Kaplan said of the development of the episode that, "It was very creative and very rewarding for us as an art department, to create the complete total look of being in another culture." Several Spanish songs are featured in the episode. When the characters are at the cantina, the song "La Calentura" by Roberto Ruiz is playing. During scenes in the garage "Juana La Cubana" by Fito Olivares is featured.Reception."John Doe" first aired in the United States on January 13, 2002. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.0, meaning that it was seen by 5.0% of the nation's estimated households and was viewed by 5.28 million households. "John Doe" was the 66th most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending January 13. The episode later aired in the United Kingdom on December 16, 2002 on BBC Two.The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– rating. Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named "John Doe" the best stand-alone episode of season nine and called it "a refreshing change of pace". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two praised Gilligan's script and Patrick's performance, noting that the former "writes the script with a dirtiness that gives it real power" and the latter's acting was "extraordinary". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote that "'John Doe' shows that there's still a fresh take to be had on "The X-Files" after all". Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it "a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season, both in its script and in its shooting." She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done, and the script focused on "strong character arcs", which worked towards its advantage. In the end, she concluded that the episode was "part of the "X-Files", moreso than would an alien or a mutant" because it focused on the idea that "pain makes you, more pain makes you better, and living within that pain keeps you alive."</doc>
<doc id="19266144" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19266144" title="Improbable (The X-Files)">Improbable (The X-Files)"Improbable" is 13th episode of the ninth season and the 195th episode overall of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". The episode first aired in the United States on April 14, 2002 on Fox, and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom. It was written and directed by series creator and executive producer Chris Carter. The episode is a "monster-of-the-week" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of "The X-Files". The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.1 and was viewed by 9.1 million viewers. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Reyes and her fellow agents investigate a serial killer who uses numerology to choose his victims. Soon, Reyes and Scully meet an unusual man who may prove more of a hindrance than a help."Improbable" features Burt Reynolds playing God. Reynolds was chosen after he expressed his desire to appear in an episode of "The X-Files" to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea and Reynolds thoroughly enjoyed filming the episode. "Improbable" contains several elaborate effects, such as a cityscape rendered to look like Reynolds' head. Furthermore, the episode contains themes pertaining to fate, free will, and numerology. The tagline for this episode is "Dio Ti Ama", meaning "God loves you" in Italian, replacing the usual phrase "The Truth is Out There."Plot.Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is investigating a series of cases that she believes are linked by numerology. While explaining the case to Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Scully spots another possible link - a mark made by the killer's ring on the victims' faces. On consulting a numerologist, Reyes ties the murders together. However, the killer also finds the numerologist, murdering her.Meanwhile, the killer is shown meeting up with a mysterious man (Burt Reynolds) who seems to know a lot about him and his murderous ways. He speaks in an enigmatic way, but his words do not seem to make any difference to the killer. Reyes' numerology theories do not go down well at the FBI, but the pattern of the killings, when viewed on a map, seem to show a spiral. Scully and Reyes revisit the murdered numerologist's office and meet the killer in the elevator. Scully recognizes the ring on the killer's hand as the agents exit the elevator, and draws her gun on him. The killer slips back into the elevator and gets to the parking lot first. Reyes and Scully arrive only to see a car fleeing the garage and the gate closing behind it.They meet another person hiding in a car and demand that he come out. It is the strange man. To pass the time, Burt engages Reyes and Scully in a game of checkers, whose colors (red & black) are surrogates for Scully (a redhead) and Reyes (a brunette). These are the anticipated hair-colors of the next two victims. The exiting car was assumed to contain the killer, but realizing the killer might still be inside, they search the garage and are surprised by the killer. However, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) arrives in the nick of time to shoot him. The mysterious man has completely disappeared. In a nearby Italian neighborhood, a party is in progress. Two men sing a jovial song and lead a crowd through the streets. The camera zooms out to reveal that the entire neighborhood, when viewed from above, suggests the appearance of Burt's face, hinting to the fact that he might be God.Production.Development.Carter later explained that humorous episodes were important to the show, especially during the "pitch-black" ninth season. He reasoned "there are the downbeats, and then you need the relief in the tension." The name Vicki Burdick came from a high school student Chris Carter knew. Carter felt that he needed to kill the character "all out of fondness." Before casting Ellen Greene, Carter had first spotted her on the movie, "The Little Shop of Horrors" both in "New York and Los Angeles." The first scene shot for Greene's character took a "long day". Carter called her a "trooper" and said she was open to the direction he gave her. She had a lot of information to remember, which made the scene even more difficult. The set for that scene was created by Tim Stepeck who was the set decorator during the ninth season. Annabeth Gish later revealed that her lines were difficult to remember. She explained, "I remember learning my lines and thinking, 'Oh my God. I've got to memorize this. It's scary. Like physics united theory, all of that."This was the last episode filmed by Carter to feature Scully in the FBI autopsy scene at 20th Century Fox. The different numbers seen in this scene was used to "conceit, this idea that numerology is an important part of our life and plays a part, but it really is just used here to illustrate the idea of patterns, patterns of behavior, of the ways in which numbers rule both the universe and our lives and our ability to solve things, to solve our mysteries of life, to solve these cases, which will lead them, as we'll see as the act comes to a close here, they are both and Reyes believers of the numerological episode." The tagline for this episode is "Dio Ti Ama", meaning "God loves you" in Italian, replacing the usual phrase "The Truth is Out There." The normal line "Executive Producer: Chris Carter" is also rendered in Italian, reading, "Produttore Esecutivo: Chris Carter".Casting.Burt Reynolds was chosen for "Improbable" after he expressed his desire to appear in an episode of "The X-Files" to Robert Patrick. Carter approved the idea and told Patrick that he would "write something good". He later noted that "as a young man, meant something to me" and that the opportunity to work with him was "surreal". After Carter had written the script, he presented it to Reynolds for his approval; Reynolds approved of the script and agreed to be in the episode. Robert Patrick later noted that Reynolds "had a great time, and he loved working with everybody."Effects and music.The final scene, featuring Burt's face superimposed onto the cityscape, was created by special effects supervisor Mat Beck. The only actual footage in the scene is a pull-back shot of the carnival that was filmed 110 feet in the air via crane. A CGI cityscape was then created that resembled Burt Reynolds' head. The two shots were sewn together, and a blur effect was added to "it sell". An alternate version of the scene was created that featured Chris Carter's head instead of Reynolds'. This version was included as a bonus feature on the season nine DVD set. The score for the episode, like the rest of the series, was composed by Mark Snow. Snow based much of the music in the episode off of records made by Karl Zéro, on the request of Carter. Carter later noted that "I had heard his music and it was so far out and it fit with exactly what I wanted to do because I wanted to recreate [the yearly celebration in Little Italy. [...] I wanted to create that festival."Themes.According to Chris Carter, the "whole" idea behind the episode was about numbers and that the "significance of numbers in our lives starts here on the card table where the players are being dealt a hand each." He continued with "the idea is that we're all dealt hands, genetic hands, and maybe even numerological hands that give us basically the tools with which we deal and/or use for our lives." He further stated that the idea was that it was "free will" and "fate", continued with that fate was determined by our own genetics.This theme is profoundly demonstrated as the character of God describes three playing cards that he is using in a street-side shell game as being two clowns (joker cards) and a king in a crown, which is likely symbolic of the two thieves who were referenced in the Gospels as being crucified on either side of Jesus Christ, the king card (in a crown) being the son of God.The villain in the story, Mad Wayne, had been dealt a bad hand in life. Because of his situation, he acts on his bad impulses. Carter elaborated, "Is it fate that Wayne is about, the character, this is what I was interested in exploring here. As we'll see with the introduction in a moment of a character who throws all of this into question – God – we're going to see what his place is in all of this, or at least explore what Burt Reynolds, playing God here, has to do with the character Wayne." The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in "charge of the big game". Being that God is trying to show "us the game", as it was a "game" to be "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.Reception.Ratings."Improbable" first aired in the United States on April 14, 2002. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1, meaning that it was seen by 5.1% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 5.38 million households and 9.1 million viewers "Improbable" was the 57th most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending April 14.Reviews."Improbable" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a "B+". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode four stars out of five, and called the script "very witty". The two wrote that "the brilliance of Chris Carter's direction" allowed the viewer of the episode to see it "from God's point of view". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode "is not as smart as it thinks it is. But it's still pretty smart." John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review and gave it a 6 out of 10 rating. He wrote that "overall, this episode was amusing enough, but there was nothing about it that would prompt me to rank it as highly as the more inspired “lite” episodes of previous seasons. And considering that the sixth and seventh seasons suffered tremendously from too many episodes like this, it's a shame to see them do it again.""The Guardian" listed "Improbable" as one of the "13 best X-Files episodes ever". UGO named God/Mr. Burt as one of the "Top 11 X-Files Monsters", noting that "as creator Chris Carter imagines him, is a benevolent deity, constantly prodding his creatures to look at the patterns before them, to see the overall plan that he's laid out. He's doomed to failure, and he knows it, though it doesn't stop him from trying".</doc>

These are named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768–1822), although they were first described by Norwegian-Danish land surveyor and mathematician Caspar Wessel (1745–1818).()</ref> Argand diagrams are frequently used to plot the positions of the poles and zeroes of a function in the complex plane.The concept of the complex plane allows a geometric interpretation of complex numbers. Under addition, they add like vectors. The multiplication of two complex numbers can be expressed most easily in polar coordinates — the magnitude or "modulus" of the product is the product of the two absolute values, or moduli, and the angle or "argument" of the product is the sum of the two angles, or arguments. In particular, multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 acts as a rotation.Butterfly diagram.In the context of fast Fourier transform algorithms, a butterfly is a portion of the computation that combines the results of smaller discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) into a larger DFT, or vice versa (breaking a larger DFT up into subtransforms). The name "butterfly" comes from the shape of the data-flow diagram in the radix-2 case, as described below. The same structure can also be found in the Viterbi algorithm, used for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.The butterfly diagram show a data-flow diagram connecting the inputs "x" (left) to the outputs "y" that depend on them (right) for a "butterfly" step of a radix-2 Cooley-Tukey FFT. This diagram resembles a butterfly as in the Morpho butterfly shown for comparison), hence the name.Commutative diagram.In mathematics, and especially in category theory a commutative diagram is a diagram of objects, also known as vertices, and morphisms, also known as arrows or edges, such that when selecting two objects any directed path through the diagram leads to the same result by composition. Commutative diagrams play the role in category theory that equations play in algebra.Hasse diagrams.A Hasse diagram is a simple picture of a finite partially ordered set, forming a drawing of the partial order's transitive reduction. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from "x" to "y" precisely when "x" < "y" and there is no "z" such that "x" < "z" < "y". In this case, we say y covers x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a Hasse diagram, it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.Knot diagrams.In Knot theory a useful way to visualise and manipulate knots is to project the knot onto a plane—;think of the knot casting a shadow on the wall. A small perturbation in the choice of projection will ensure that it is one-to-one except at the double points, called "crossings", where the "shadow" of the knot crosses itself once transversely At each crossing we must indicate which section is "over" and which is "under", so as to be able to recreate the original knot. This is often done by creating a break in the strand going underneath. If by following the diagram the knot alternately crosses itself "over" and "under", then the diagram represents a particularly well-studied class of knot, alternating knots.Venn diagram.A Venn diagram is a representation of mathematical sets: a mathematical diagram representing sets as circles, with their relationships to each other expressed through their overlapping positions, so that all possible relationships between the sets are shown.The Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.Voronoi diagram.A Voronoi diagram is a special kind of decomposition of a metric space determined by distances to a specified discrete set of objects in the space, e.g., by a discrete set of points. This diagram is named after Georgy Voronoi, also called a Voronoi tessellation, a Voronoi decomposition, or a Dirichlet tessellation after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.In the simplest case, we are given a set of points S in the plane, which are the Voronoi sites. Each site s has a Voronoi cell V(s) consisting of all points closer to s than to any other site. The segments of the Voronoi diagram are all the points in the plane that are equidistant to two sites. The Voronoi nodes are the points equidistant to three (or more) sitesWallpaper group diagrams.A wallpaper group or "plane symmetry group" or "plane crystallographic group" is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern, based on the symmetries in the pattern. Such patterns occur frequently in architecture and decorative art. There are 17 possible distinct groups. Wallpaper groups are two-dimensional symmetry groups, intermediate in complexity between the simpler frieze groups and the three-dimensional crystallographic groups, also called space groups. Wallpaper groups categorize patterns by their symmetries. Subtle differences may place similar patterns in different groups, while patterns which are very different in style, color, scale or orientation may belong to the same group.Young diagram.A "Young diagram" or Young tableau, also called Ferrers diagram, is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row sizes weakly decreasing (each row has the same or shorter length than its predecessor). Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a partition formula_1 of a positive integer "n", the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape formula_1, and it carries the same information as that partition. Listing the number of boxes in each column gives another partition, the conjugate or "transpose" partition of formula_1; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.Young tableaux were introduced by Alfred Young, a mathematician at Cambridge University, in 1900. They were then applied to the study of symmetric group by Georg Frobenius in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians.</doc>
<doc id="19254301" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19254301" title="Supercharge (band)">Supercharge (band)Supercharge were a 1970s English rock band from Liverpool, founded by singer/saxophonist Albie Donnelly and drummer Dave Irving. They had a number three hit single in Australia with "You've Gotta Get Up and Dance" in 1977.History.Beginnings and Australian success.Founded in early 1974, by Liverpool tenor-saxophonist, Albie Donnelly (born Albert Edward Donnelly, 12 August 1947, Huyton, Liverpool), and drummer Dave Irving (born David Geddes Irving, 18 November 1946, Crosby, Liverpool) after they had both left the 'In Crowd' cabaret band, Supercharge soon built up quite a cult following in Liverpool at 'The Sportsman', a popular city-centre pub on Sunday and later Monday nights and also at the 'Dove and Olive' at Speke.Original members included Donnelly (bandleader, vocalist, and tenor saxophonist), Ozzie Yue (guitar/vocals) (born Austin J Yue, 12 August 1947, Liverpool), Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell (tenor sax, guitar, harmonica, and vocals), Alan Peters (trumpet), Bob Robertson (baritone sax), Pete Newton (bass guitar), Tony Dunmore (bass) and Dave Irving (drums).Supercharge also quickly established themselves as a major player on the UK college / university circuit. Their first album "Between Music and Madness", which was locally produced, soon followed.Around 1975, in an attempt to attract a major record label offer, Supercharge began to gig regularly on the London live circuit at venues such as the Hope and Anchor, Islington, the Nashville Rooms, and the Marquee Club. As a result, Supercharge were soon signed by Virgin Records, and with the company's new record producer, Robert "Mutt" Lange, they had a number three hit in Australia with their 1976 single "You've Gotta Get Up and Dance". Personnel on these recordings also included organist Iain Bradshaw. It was also in Australia that their first album, "Local Lads Make Good" went gold - resulting in a number of successful major tours with a version of the band that included Les Karski on guitar.These live UK gigs often featured celebrated live sound engineer Chrys Lindop, and included the infamous comedy track 'She Moved The Dishes First', which Donnelly claims they wrote so they could mess about a bit while the band were replacing broken guitar strings. This track also achieved notoriety when it was picked up and played regularly by Radio Caroline.Meanwhile, back in the UK, although their record sales were disappointing, Supercharge still managed to achieve a reputation as one of the UK's best live bands. This included Supercharge's opening set for Queen at the 1976 Hyde Park Festival. However, it was becoming clear to Donnelly that Virgin did not really know what to do with them, and they eventually parted company sometime during the punk era.Despite their reputation as a killer band live, Richard Branson decided that after two albums without major success that he would only offer Donnelly / Karski a continuous deal. The rest of the band became redundant, and ironically months later the 'Local lads' album went gold in Australia. However, the deed had been done, and Donnelly resorted to taking a scratch band to do the hit tour in Australia much to the chagrin of the original guys who had put all the hard studio and roadwork in to get the band where it was.Success in Europe.The next chapter in Supercharge's history was the invasion of Europe, which began at the end of the 1970s-early 1980s. By now the band also featured Andy Parker on vocals and saxophone. Other members (at one time or another) included Mike Snow - trumpet; Dick Hansen - trumpet; John Burke - trumpet Tony Winders - guitar; Phil Loughran - guitar; Tony Judge - piano; Steve Snow - trombone; Paul Ambrosius - bass/vocals; Dave Dover - bass; Kenny Shearer - bass; Dave 'The Frug' Hormbrey - drums; Tony Lunney - drums. Albums during this early period included, "Now Jump", and "Kingsize".In late 1983, the Liverpool band Juke (Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell - tenor saxophone, guitar, harmonica, bass, vocals; Mickey Kearns - baritone sax; guitar; vocals; Bob Hardy - bandleader, keyboards, guitar, vocals; Dave Sheppley - guitar, bass, vocals; Paddy Chambers - guitar, vocals; Steve Grant - drums, vocal) struck a deal with Donnelly and his then manager, "Memo" Rhein, to work together for the next twelve months as Supercharge '84. This version of the band was so successful that at the end of 1984, Donnelly and Rhein persuaded them to stay on for a further five months.During the time that Juke and Donnelly were together they managed to clock up well over 200 gigs. Many of these were for Europe's 'Jet-Set', and included the wedding of Tina Onassis (which resulted in the 1984 album "Groovers In Paris" - which is still Supercharge's top selling rhythm and blues album). Gigs also included parties for Gunter Sachs at the Dracula' Club in St. Moritz; and a New Year's Eve party in Marbella for Adnan Khashoggi.Mid 1980s.The next version of Supercharge began performing live in mid-1985, and moved away from the successful horn driven 'Rhythm and Blues-Maximum Show' format of Supercharge '84, and instead featured material written mainly by guitarist/vocalist Colin Frost and pianist Tony Judge. This version of the band also included bassist Brendan O'Connor.In 1986/7, guitarist Dave Shepley (who had been a member of Juke and had switched to bass in Supercharge '84) and guitarist/vocalist John "Fat Ted" Lewis, helped Donnelly to once again convert Supercharge into a major player on the late 1980s and early 1990s European Jazz and Rhythm and Blues live-scene.This powerhouse rhythm and blues version of Supercharge (which at various times included: Andy Parker - vocal and tenor saxophone; Steve Snow - trombone; Dick Hansen - trumpet Tony Peers - trumpet; Paul Latham - trombone; Graham Price - bass; John "Fat Ted" Lewis - guitar and vocal; Roy "The Boy" Herrington - guitar; Dave Sheppley- guitar; Lenni Zaksen - tenor saxophone; Terry Kennaugh - guitar; Mal Bowers - keyboards; Paul Hetherington - bass; Tony Lunney - drums) quickly began to pick up a number of major tours with artists such as Chuck Berry and B.B. King, and this soon took the band back to stadiums and bigger concert hall gigs, where they still perform.Nashville keyboard-player and vocalist Greg Barrett joined in the late 1980s and demonstrated a more soulful side of Supercharge. This version of the band usually included Greg Barrett - keyboards, vocal; Albie Donnelly - tenor saxophone; Paul Owens - baritone saxophone; Dick Hansen - trumpet; Roy "The Boy" Herrington - guitar; Wolfgang "Bolle" Diekmann - bass; Tony Lunney - drums.Donnelly also began experimenting with smaller outfits around this time, the most popular being Albie Donnelly's Big Three which included Gregory Gaynair on piano and Wolfgang Diekmann on bass.From 2000 to date.From 2000 to date, Donnelly is still fronting a R&B band - with a version of Supercharge that now consists mainly of a number of top German R&B musicians, including Juergen Wieching on saxophone, and Mike Rafalczyk on trombone and Wolfgang Diekmann on bass..Donnelly also featured on a CD, "Return Cargo". In addition to Supercharge regulars, the recording also features the original Supercharge drummer, Dave Irving.Over the years Donnelly has been an official endorser for a number of saxophone companies, including Keilwerth and Yamaha; he has also provided a great deal of regular work for a number of Liverpool's top musicians.Since 2010 the band line-up has been Albie Donnelly - alto and tenor saxophones, lead vocals; Roy Herrington - guitar, vocals; Jürgen Wieching - baritone and alto saxophones; Mike Rafalcyk - trombone, harmonica; Sascha Kühn - keyboards; Wolfgang Diekmann - bass; Uwe Petersen - drums.Allen 'Gaz' Gaskell has since gone on to form Merseyside-based sextet "Jazz Junction".Discography.Albums.NB: all Virgin albums were produced by Robert John "Mutt" Lange</doc>
<doc id="19255148" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19255148" title="Regulation and monitoring of pollution">Regulation and monitoring of pollutionTo protect the environment from the adverse effects of pollution, many nations worldwide have enacted legislation to regulate various types of pollution as well as to mitigate the adverse effects of pollution.Regulation and monitoring by region.International.Since pollution crosses political boundaries international treaties have been made through the United Nations and its agencies to address international pollution issues.Greenhouse gas emissions.The Kyoto Protocol is an amendment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international treaty on global warming. It also reaffirms sections of the UNFCCC. Countries which ratify this protocol commit to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases, or engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases. A total of 141 countries have ratified the agreement. Notable exceptions include the United States and Australia, who have signed but not ratified the agreement. The stated reason for the United States not ratifying is the exemption of large emitters of greenhouse gases who are also developing countries, like China and India.An UN environmental conference held in Bali 3–14 December 2007 with the participation from 180 countries aims to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which will end in 2012. During the first day of the conference USA, Saudi Arabia and Canada were presented with the "Fossil-of-the-day-award", a symbolic bag of coal for their negative impact on the global climate. The bags included the flags of the respective countries.Also another protocol named the earth summit was enacted by WHO(World Health Organization)on 1921 to check global warming and also to reduce the emissions of the greenhouse gases.Canada.In Canada the regulation of pollution and its effects are monitored by a number of organizations depending on the nature of the pollution and its location. The three levels of government (Federal – Canada Wide; Provincial; and Municipal) equally share in the responsibilities, and in the monitoring and correction of pollution.China.China's rapid industrialization has substantially increased pollution. China has some relevant regulations: the 1979 Environmental Protection Law, which was largely modeled on U.S. legislation, but the environment continues to deteriorate. Twelve years after the law, only one Chinese city was making an effort to clean up its water discharges. This indicates that China is about 30 years behind the U.S. schedule of environmental regulation and 10 to 20 years behind Europe. In July 2007, it was reported that the World Bank reluctantly censored a report revealing that 750,000 people in China die every year as a result of pollution-related diseases. China's State Environment Protection Agency and the Health Ministry asked the World Bank to cut the calculations of premature deaths from the report fearing the revelation would provoke "social unrest".Europe.The basic European rules are included in the Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) and the National Emission Ceilings Directive.United Kingdom.In the 1840s, the United Kingdom brought onto the statute books legislation to control water pollution. It was extended to all rivers and coastal water by 1961. However, currently the clean up of historic contamination is controlled under a specific statutory scheme found in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (Part IIA), as inserted by the Environment Act 1995, and other ‘rules’ found in regulations and statutory guidance. The Act came into force in England in April 2000.Within the current regulatory framework, Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) is a regime for controlling pollution from certain industrial activities. The regime introduces the concept of Best Available Techniques ("BAT") to environmental regulations. Operators must use the BAT to control pollution from their industrial activities to prevent, and where that is not practicable, to reduce to acceptable levels, pollution to air, land and water from industrial activities. The Best Available Techniques also aim to balance the cost to the operator against benefits to the environment.The system of Pollution Prevention and Control is replacing that of Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) (which was established by the Environmental Protection Act 1990) and is taking effect between 2000 and 2007. The Pollution Prevention and Control regime implements the European Directive (EC/96/61) on integrated pollution prevention and control.United States.The United States Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1963 to legislate the reduction of smog and atmospheric pollution in general. That legislation has subsequently been amended and extended in 1966, 1970, 1977 and 1990. Numerous state and local governments have enacted similar legislation either implementing or filling in locally important gaps in the national program. The national Clean Air Act and similar state legislative acts have led to the widespread use of atmospheric dispersion modeling in order to analyze the air quality impacts of proposed major actions. With the 1990 Clean Air Act, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began a controversial carbon trading system in which tradable rights to emit a specified level of carbon are granted to polluters.Enactment of the 1972 Clean Water Act required facilities to obtain permits for discharges to navigable waters and establishment of national discharge standards for municipal sewage treatment plants and many industrial categories. It required use of best management practices for a wide range of other water discharges including nonpoint source pollution. Amendments in 1977 required stricter regulation of toxic pollutants. In 1987 Congress added permit coverage for municipal and industrial stormwater discharges.Congress passed the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) in 1976, which created a regulatory framework for both municipal solid waste and hazardous waste disposed on land. RCRA requires that all hazardous wastes be managed and tracked from generation of the waste, through transport and processing, to final disposal, by means of a nationwide permit system. The Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 mandated regulation of underground storage tanks containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals, and the phasing out of land disposal of hazardous waste. The Federal Facilities Compliance Act, passed in 1992, clarified RCRA coverage of federally owned properties such as military bases. Illegal disposal of waste is punishable by fines of up to $25,000 per occurrence.Passage of the Noise Control Act in 1972 established mechanisms of setting emission standards for virtually every source of noise including motor vehicles, aircraft, certain types of HVAC equipment and major appliances. It also put local government on notice as to their responsibilities in land use planning to address noise mitigation. This noise regulation framework comprised a broad data base detailing the extent of noise health effects. Congress ended funding of the federal noise control program in 1981, which curtailed development of further national regulations.The state of California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has maintained an independent list of substances with product labeling requirements as part of Proposition 65 since 1986.</doc>
<doc id="19207490" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19207490" title="Union Labor Party (California)">Union Labor Party (California)The Union Labor Party was a San Francisco, California working class political party of the first decade of the 20th century. The organization, which endorsed the doctrine of nativism, rose to prominence in both the labor movement and urban politics in the years after 1901, electing its nominee as Mayor of San Francisco in 1909.Organizational history.Background.During the first decade of the 20th century, employers across America made effective use of judicial injunctions to prohibit trade unions from engaging in strikes to win recognition for themselves and wage-and-hour gains for their members. This so-called "open shop drive" put organized labor, concentrated in an array of local and international craft unions joined under the umbrella of the American Federation of Labor on the defensive.In San Francisco, one of the most heavily unionized cities in the country, matters came to a head in the summer of 1901 when a local employers' association, the Draymen's Association, locked out the city's unionized teamsters on July 21. The lockout spread to the entire waterfront, which saw the city's transportation essentially shut down.Strikebreakers were imported by the employers, who were met by force, leading to calls by the employers for police assistance. When police were deployed by the Chief of Police, the city's 14 maritime unions joined together in the City Front Federation and voted to initiate a mass sympathy strike in support of the locked out teamsters, rather than see the teamsters' union crushed. Some 16,000 longshoremen, clerks, packers, and warehouse workers joined the work stoppage, thereby increasing the volatility of the situation.San Francisco's Democratic mayor, James D. Phelan, who had been elected thanks in large measure to the support of organized labor, sided with the employers in the battle and gave the Chief of Police authorization to smash the strike. Extreme violence followed, in which picketing workers were clubbed and even shot, resulting in 5 deaths and 336 reported cases of assault. Hundreds more strikers were arrested.The perceived "treachery" of Mayor Phelan caused San Francisco's organized labor movement to rethink its previous strategy of attempting to elect and influence its "friends" in the Democratic and Republican parties. Instead, the unions sought an independent political organization to elect their own people to positions of power so that the violence of the state would not be turned against them in a future replay of the strike of 1901.The Union Labor Party was the result of this change of perspective.Union formed.On September 5, 1901, approximately 300 delegates representing 68 of San Francisco's unions gathered together in a convention to establish the Union Labor Party of the City and County of San Francisco. The convention approved a platform including a call for the revision of the city charter to curb future intervention by the city administration in labor disputes, a demand for municipal ownership of all public utilities, building more schools and the initiation of the merit system in the promotion of teachers, and the abolition of the poll tax. The platform also contained a frankly nativist demand for the restriction of Asian immigration and the creation of segregated schools for Asian children.The new political party nominated Eugene E. Schmitz, president of the Musicians' Union, as its candidate for Mayor. He was backed by lawyer and political boss Abe Ruef, who threw his considerable influence behind Schmitz. The union put up a slate of its candidates for all other elected positions. The organization was ultimately endorsed by every San Francisco union with the exception of the local Building Trades Council and was bitterly opposed by every newspaper with the exception of the "San Francisco Examiner," owned by William Randolph Hearst.The election of November 1901 proved a great triumph for the union, with its mayoral candidate winning election by a plurality of over 20,000 votes. Three of its members were elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and the group fell just 50 votes short of electing 3 more.Immediately after the election, the teamsters' strike was finally settled in favor of the trade unions. Strikebreakers were discharged and the striking unionized workers were reinstated. The Teamsters Union was recognized, the union wage scale initiated, and the 48-hour week established. While the union demand for a closed shop was not immediately granted, the year 1901 nevertheless marked a major victory for organized labor and marked a high-water mark for the trade unions of San Francisco and their Union Labor Party.The ULP in power.With City Hall in the hands of the Union Labor Party, San Francisco's trade unions launched a series of successful strikes in 1902. The city's streetcar employees launched a strike to reverse a 1901 wage cut and to win union recognition, an action which snarled San Francisco's internal transportation. The United Railway Company, employer of the streetcar workers, attempted to import strikebreakers, but this time the ULP Mayor of San Francisco prohibited the company's request for a police guard and ordered that no special permits be granted for security guards to carry firearms. Eight days later, the company signed a contract with its employees which granted all of the union's demands.Despite some misgivings on the party of Samuel Gompers and other national officials of the American Federation of Labor, the ULP continued its electoral success in 1903, when Eugene Schmitz was renominated for Mayor of San Francisco and won re-election by more than 26,000 votes.Anti-union forces may have been defeated in the elections, but by no means was there an end to their own organizing. In 1904 there came to San Francisco a new organization known as the Citizen's Alliance, headed by Herbert George, one of the city's leaders of the open shop movement. George initially launched the Citizens' Alliance in Denver, Colorado with great success before importing the organization to the less hospitable soil of the city by the bay. By the end of 1904, George's organization claimed a membership of 16,000, including employers pledged to restore "the Americanism of the Open Shop in San Francisco."In the election of 1905, the Citizens' Alliance sought to fragment the union opposition by launching a puppet organization called the United Labor League. The Citizens' Alliance counted on a split of the labor movement, centered around the conservative Building Trades Council headed by P.H. McCarthy, against which would be pitted a fusion candidate combining the forces of the Republicans and the Democrats under the slogan of "Law and Order."Contrary to the best-laid plans of the open shop advocates, McCarthy and the previously resistant Building Trades Council united behind Schmitz and the Union Labor Party in the election of 1905, helping him to win a third term of office.The ULP in retreat.The year 1907 marked the watershed for the Union Labor Party. In that year, a series of revelations took place detailing graft and corruption in municipal administration, culminating in an investigation and prosecution that showed that the Union Labor Party and the city's Mayor were in the control of political boss Abe Ruef, who received financial kickbacks in the guise of legal fees from public utilities, gambling houses, and houses of prostitution. The fall of Mayor Eugene Schmitz in the midst of the San Francisco Streetcar Strike of 1907 undermined the strike effort, which ended in utter failure after months of violence between the Carmen's Union and out-of-town mercenary strikebreakers.While little different from the corruption in other major American cities, such as Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Chicago, and New York, the San Francisco city graft scandal drew deafening wails of criticism from the local and national press, which sought to emphasize an inevitable connection between labor unions and official dishonesty.The ULP's 1909 platform advocated public ownership of utilities, a new civic auditorium, extensive public works, and a U.S. citizen-only hiring policy. The ULP nominated and elected the conservative P.H. McCarthy of the San Francisco Building Trades Council in the 1909 mayoral election. While McCarthy's administration was largely scandal-free, it suffered from a number of political failures.Businessmen chose James Rolph, Jr., known as "Sunny Jim", to run against him in 1911. Rolph won that election and the ULP faded from the scene.</doc>
<doc id="19196440" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19196440" title="Lock's Quest">Lock's Quest"Lock's Quest" is a real-time strategy video game developed by 5th Cell and published by THQ. This is 5th Cell's second Nintendo DS game. It was released in North America on September 8, 2008, in Europe on September 26, 2008 and in Australia on September 25, 2008.Gameplay."Lock's Quest" is a real-time strategy game, incorporating tower defense gameplay elements. The battlefield, viewed from an isometric perspective, is displayed on the DS's bottom screen. Combat is divided into two phases, Build and Battle. During the Build phase, the player has a limited amount of time and resources to construct defenses, which consist of walls, towers, cannons, machines, and traps. Once the Build phase ends, the Battle phase begins. Lock can repair damage to the defenses or fight enemies, with each action having a corresponding minigame.Both battle phases make good use of the touch screen, as the player can utilise sliding and twisting movements with the stylus to activate various upgrades and abilities.Plot.The game is set in a kingdom, built using a mysterious substance known as "Source". The builders of this kingdom, the "Archineers", studied source in an attempt to better understand its properties. The greatest archineer was Agonius, who discovered a truly remarkable property of source - that it can emulate life. Agonius started creating lifelike beings from the source, but the King, who understood the dangers of this, demanded that Agonius halt his work. Agonius refused, and so was banished from the kingdom.Seeking vengeance upon the King, Agonius assumed the mantle of Lord Agony and created a clockwork army with the intent of destroying the kingdom. A war ensued, with heavy casualties on both sides. Eventually, two kingdom archineers, Kenan and Jacob, infiltrated Agony's fortress. The exact nature of the events that happened therein are not revealed until the end of the game - all that is known, at first, is that Agony was defeated, and Jacob was missing, presumed dead. Kenan, now a hero, took up the position of Chief Archineer.The game itself begins some years after the events above. We are introduced to Lock, a young man living in a coastal village, along with his sister, Emi, and grandfather, Tobias. When this village (and indeed the entire kingdom) is attacked by a new army of clockworks, under a new Lord Agony, Lock enlists as an archineer and helps to fight the clockworks. After a long time, the Kingdom force prevails and the new Agony is defeated.At the climax of the plot, it is revealed that the new Lord Agony is none other than Jacob. Long ago, when Jacob reached Agonius' chamber, he found Agonius a frail and broken man. He also found the young Lock, who was himself clockwork, the greatest creation of Agonius. Jacob took Lock and raised him as a human, under the guise of Tobias. He created Emi, who is also clockwork, and the village in which Lock was raised.At the end of the game, the King tells Lock that, despite being clockwork, he was truly alive, because Agonius had given Lock his soul. Conversely, Jacob could not bring himself to sacrifice his soul in order to give Emi true life, and so, in time, Emi would simply crumble to dust.However, it is implied that Jacob, repentant and sorrowful for having waged war on the Kingdom, did eventually do so at Lock's request, and the final scene of the game is Lock and Emi playing tag on the beach.Development.THQ announced the development of "Lock's Quest" on April 1, 2008 in a press release. In a preview of the game on April 2, 2008, IGN wrote of their experience of the game, "We're still early on in "Lock's Quest", but it has the potential to be one of the top strategy games on DS before all is said and done." In July, at the San Diego Comic Convention, THQ debuted a promotional mini-comic based on the universe of the game entitled "Lock's Quest: A Source of Hope - Volume 1" drawn by Edison Yan. IGN awarded "Lock's Quest" its "Best Strategy Game" award for the Nintendo DS at E3 2008.Reception."Lock's Quest" was well received by most critics. IGN praised most aspects of the game, writing, ""Lock's Quest" is by far one of the most original, inspired, and entertaining experiences we've had on DS this year.", receiving an Editors' Choice Award and DS Game of the Month for September. 1UP.com criticized the un-skippable cut scenes, but said it "succeeds as both a love letter to, and an evolution of, the tower-defense genre." Nintendo World Report said "Lock's Quest" was "just a few design tweaks away from being a fantastic game.", claiming that it is "definitely disappointing in light of all its great assets and originality." GameZone called it "unique" and "perfectly suited for the DS". GameDaily praised the story, gameplay, graphics and music, and called it "an excellent game." GameSpot praised the "lengthy single-player campaign, exciting multiplayer, and addictive gameplay." EuroGamer criticized the battle phase of combat and the enemy artificial intelligence, while praising the "excellent graphics and repetitive but gripping gameplay." It was a nominee for two Nintendo DS-specific awards from IGN for their 2008 video game awards, including Best Strategy Game and Best New IP. GameSpot nominated it for Best Game No One Played.</doc>
<doc id="19281165" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19281165" title="Meleke">MelekeMeleke (, "royal", "kingly") — also transliterated melekeh or malaki — is a lithologic type of white, coarsely crystalline, thickly bedded limestone found in the Judean Hills in Israel and the West Bank. It has been used in the traditional architecture of Jerusalem since ancient times, especially in Herodian architecture. Though it is often popularly referred to as Jerusalem stone, this phrase can refer to a number of different types of stone found and used in, or associated with, Jerusalem.Name."Meleke" is an Arabic word that originated in the jargon of local stonemasons. Translated as "kingly stone", (or "queenly"), "royal stone", or "stone of kings", the source of the word's meaning may derive from "meleke"'s use in all the monumental tombs of Jerusalem. Israeli building stone authority Asher Shadmon cites the word as one of the local or colloquial "mason's terms" that have been "adopted by geologists" and are applied in the technical literature.Description.Meleke is quarried from the Upper Turonian Stage of the Bina (Baana) Formation of Late Cretaceous age, a layer about 10 meters in thickness and about 90 million years old. When freshly cut, it is a pure white limestone. It may retain its white color for many years or it may be insolated to a light golden yellow. The aged stone has a typical golden hue, but may range in tone from pinkish to off-white. When quarried it is soft and quite workable, but upon exposure it hardens and develops a clear surface that will take on a high polish. Meleke withstands natural erosion very well and provides a high-quality building stone, as well as commercial marble.History.Used as a building material since ancient times, this "royal stone" has been of great importance to the history of the city of Jerusalem. When it is first exposed to the air it can be soft enough to be cut with a knife, but exposed to the air it hardens to make a stone of considerable durability, useful for building. Hundreds of caverns, cisterns, tombs and aqueducts in Jerusalem have been excavated from this stone. According to a long-standing legend, "Zedekiah's Cave", a large ancient meleke cave/quarry near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's Old City, was the source of the building material for Solomon's First Temple. Richard S. Barnett writes that ashlars in the Western Wall and the outer retaining wall of the extended Herodian Temple platform were apparently cut from meleke quarries near Bezetha.The courtyard of the Tomb of Helena of Adiabene was originally a meleke stone quarry, and the staircase once a ramp upon which the blocks extracted were hauled. Of the four types of limestone found in the Jerusalem region, two were used in building during the Islamic period in Palestine: "meleke" and "mizzi", the latter being a harder stone, also known as "Palestinian marble".The use of meleke was popular among the Frankish stonemasons of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in Palestine, who quarried it to make fine, carefully drafted building stones for use in door and window features, among other architectural features. Frankish markings from the distinctive diagnol tools used by their stonemasons can be seen on meleke stones put to secondary use in the walls surrounding the Old City of Jerusalem.In archaeological excavations.High quality, meleke limestone has been found wherever excavations in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre have reached bedrock. Beginning in about the seventh or eighth century BCE, the area where the church is now located was a large quarry, with the city of Jerusalem lying to the southeast. Traces of the quarry have been found not only in the church area, but also in excavations conducted nearby in the 1960s and 1970s by Kathleen Kenyon in the Muristan enclave of Jerusalem's Christian Quarter, and by Ute Lux, in the nearby Church of the Redeemer. Meleke stone was chiseled out in squarish blocks and partially cut ashlars still attached to the bedrock after being left by the workers were found. East of St. Helena's Chapel in the Holy Sepulchre Church, the quarry was over 40 feet deep and the earth and ash therein contained Iron Age II pottery, from about the seventh century BCE.According to Virgilio C. Corbo, professor of archaeology at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem, the quarry continued to be used until the first century BCE, at which time it was filled, and covered with a layer of reddish-brown soil mixed with stone flakes from the ancient quarry. It became a garden or orchard, where cereals, fig, carob, and olive trees were grown. It also served as a cemetery, and at least four tombs dating from this period have been found, including a typical "kokh" tomb thought to be that of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea.A salvage excavation conducted by the Israeli Antiquities Authority in June 2006 in the Sanhedriya neighborhood of Jerusalem exposed another ancient masonry meleke quarry. Larger than the area excavated, the quarry abutted onto the southern end of the Second Temple-period Tombs of the Sanhedrin, between which extensive ancient quarries had previously been discovered.The quarry seems to have been in operation in the Roman period, though precise dating was difficult because the quarrying debris was devoid of coins and potsherds, and modern debris had entered the site. A few pottery fragments from the end of the first century BCE to the first century CE found on the bottom of the quarry units formed the basis for the dating put forward, and the quarry's proximity to the Sanhedrin tombs of the Second Temple period has also led archaeologists to assume it was in use during that time.The exposed quarry is just one of a number of ancient quarries discovered in the Sanhedriya-Mahanayim region whose stones were utilized in the public construction of Jerusalem.</doc>
<doc id="19282430" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19282430" title="Pre-Columbian Mexico">Pre-Columbian MexicoThe pre-Columbian history of the territory now comprising contemporary Mexico is known through the work of archaeologists and epigraphers, and through the accounts of the conquistadors, clergymen, and indigenous chroniclers of the immediate post-conquest period. While relatively few documents (or codices) of the Mixtec and Aztec cultures of the Post-Classic period survived the Spanish conquest, more progress has been made in the area of Mayan archaeology and epigraphy.[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/01/0105_060105_maya_writing.html]Human presence in the Mexican region was once thought to date back 40,000 years based upon what were believed to be ancient human footprints discovered in the Valley of Mexico, but after further investigation using radioactive dating, it appears this is untrue. It is currently unclear whether 21,000-year-old campfire remains found in the Valley of Mexico are the earliest human remains in Mexico. Indigenous peoples of Mexico began to selectively breed maize plants around 8000 BC. Evidence shows a marked increase in pottery working by 2300 B.C. and the beginning of intensive corn farming between 1800 and 1500 B.C..Between 1800 and 300 BC, complex cultures began to form. Many matured into advanced pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations such as the: Olmec, Izapa, Teotihuacan, Maya, Zapotec, Mixtec, Huastec, Purepecha, Totonac, Tarascan, "Toltec" and Aztec, which flourished for nearly 4,000 years before the first contact with Europeans.Accomplishments.These civilizations are credited with many inventions and advancements including pyramid-temples, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and theology. Archaic inscriptions on rocks and rock walls all over northern Mexico (especially in the state of Nuevo León) demonstrate an early propensity for counting in Mexico. These very early and ancient count-markings were associated with astronomical events and underscore the influence that astronomical activities had upon Mexican natives, even before they possessed urbanization. In fact, many of the later Mexican-based civilizations would carefully build their cities and ceremonial centers according to specific astronomical events. Astronomy and the notion of human observation of celestial events would become central factors in the development of religious systems, writing systems, fine arts, and architecture. Prehistoric Mexican astronomers began a tradition of precise observing, recording, and commemorating astronomical events that later become a hallmark of Mexican civilized achievements. Cities would be founded and built on astronomical principles, leaders would be appointed on celestial events, wars would be fought according to solar-calendars, and a complex theology using astronomical metaphors would organize the daily lives of millions of people.At some different points in time, three Mexican cities (Teotihuacan, Tenochtitlan, and Cholula) were among the largest cities in the world. These cities and several others blossomed as centers of commerce, ideas, ceremonies, and theology. In turn, they radiated influence outward into neighboring cultures in central Mexico.Oasisamerica.At its height, Oasisamerica covered part of the present-day Mexican states of Chihuahua, Sonora and Baja California, as well as the U.S. states of Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and California. Cultural groups that flourished partially within the borders of modern-day Mexico include the Mogollon, Patayan, and Hohokam. There were close ties between the civilizations of Oasisamerica and those of Mesoamerica, evidenced by turquoise trade and cultural exchange. For example, in Paquimé, a site connected to the Mogollon culture, there have been found ceremonial structures related to Mesoamerican religion, similar to the juego de pelota.Mesoamerica.While many city-states, kingdoms, and empires competed with one another for power and prestige, Mexico can be said to have had five major civilizations: The Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Toltec, the Aztec and the Maya. These civilizations (with the exception of the politically fragmented Maya) extended their reach across Mexico, and beyond, like no others. They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and theology. Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these five civilizations over the span of 3,000 years. Many made war with them. But almost all found themselves within these five spheres of influence.Olmec civilization.The Olmec were an ancient Pre-Columbian people living in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, roughly in what are the modern-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Their immediate cultural influence, however, extends far beyond this region. The Olmec flourished during the Formative (or Preclassic) period, dating from 1400 BCE to about 400 BCE, and are believed to have been the progenitor civilization of later Mesoamerican civilizations.Teotihuacan civilization.The decline of the Olmec resulted in a power vacuum in Mexico. Emerging from that vacuum was Teotihuacan, first settled in 300 B.C. By AD 150, it had grown to become the first true metropolis of what is now called North America. Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order never before seen in Mexico. Its influence stretched across Mexico into Central America, founding new dynasties in the Mayan cities of Tikal, Copan, and Kaminaljuyú. Teotihuacan's influence over the Maya civilization cannot be overstated; it transformed political power, artistic depictions, and the nature of economics. Within the city of Teotihuacan was a diverse and cosmopolitan population. Most of the regional ethnicities of Mexico were represented in the city, such as Zapotecs from the Oaxaca region. They lived in rural apartment communities where they worked their trades and contributed to the city's economic and cultural prowess. By AD 500, Teotihuacan had become one of the largest cities in the world. Teotihuacan's economic pull impacted areas in northern Mexico as well. It was a city whose monumental architecture reflected a new era in Mexican civilization, declining in political power about AD 650, but lasting in cultural influence for the better part of a millennium, to around AD 950.Maya civilization.Contemporary with Teotihuacan's greatness was the greatness of the Mayan civilization. The period between 250 and 650 saw an intense flourishing of Maya civilized accomplishments. While the many Maya city-states never achieved political unity on the order of the central Mexican civilizations, they exerted a tremendous intellectual influence upon Mexico. The Maya built some of the most elaborate cities on the continent, and made innovations in mathematics, astronomy, and writing that became the pinnacle of Mexico's scientific achievements.Toltec civilization.Just as Teotihuacan had emerged from a power vacuum, so too did the Toltec civilization, which took the reins of cultural and political power in Mexico from about 700. The Toltec empire established contact as far south as Central America, and as far north as the Anasazi corn culture in the Southwestern United States. The Toltec established a prosperous turquoise trade route with the northern civilization of Pueblo Bonito, in modern-day New Mexico. Toltec traders would trade prized bird feathers with Pueblo Bonito, while circulating all the finest wares that Mexico had to offer with their divorced, immediate neighbors. The Mayan city of Chichen Itza was also in contact with the Toltec civilization were powerfully influenced by central Mexicans. The Toltec political system was so influential, that many future Mesoamerican dynasties would later claim to be of Toltec descent. In fact, it was this prized Toltec lineage that would set the stage for Mesoamerica's last great indigenous civilization.Aztec civilization.With the decline of the Toltec civilization came political fragmentation in the Valley of Mexico, and into this new game of political contenders for the Toltec throne stepped outsiders: the Aztec. Newcomers to the Valley of Mexico, they were seen as crude and unrefined in the eyes of the existing Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the fallen Toltec empire. Latecomers to Mexico's central plateau, the Aztecs thought of themselves as heirs to the prestigious civilizations that had preceded them, much as Charlemagne did with respect to the fallen Roman Empire. What the Aztecs lacked in political power, they made up for with ambition and military skill. In 1428, the Aztecs led a war of liberation against their rulers from the city of Azcapotzalco, which had subjugated most of the Valley of Mexico's peoples. The revolt was successful, and the Aztecs, through cunning political maneuvers and ferocious fighting skills, managed to pull off a true "rags-to-riches" story: they became the rulers of central Mexico as the leaders of the Triple Alliance. This Alliance was composed of the city-states of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. At their peak, 350,000 Aztecs presided over a wealthy tribute-empire comprising around 10 million people, almost half of Mexico's then-estimated population of 24 million. This empire stretched from ocean to ocean, and extended into Central America. The westward expansion of the empire was stopped cold by a devastating military defeat at the hands of the Purepecha (who possessed state-of-the-art copper-metal weapons). The empire relied upon a system of taxation (of goods and services) which were collected through an elaborate bureaucracy of tax collectors, courts, civil servants, and local officials who were installed as loyalists to the Triple Alliance (led by Tenochtitlan). The empire was primarily economic in nature, and the Triple Alliance grew very rich: libraries were built, monumental architecture was constructed, and a highly prestigious artistic and priestly class was cultivated. All of this created a "First World" aura of invincibility around the island-city of Tenochtitlan. Unlike the later Spanish, the Aztecs did not seek to "convert" or destroy the cultures they conquered. Quite the opposite: the engines of warfare and empire in Central Mexico required that all participants understand and accept common cultural "rules" in order to make the flow of imperial wealth as smooth as possible. The rules of empire in Mexico were old rules, understood by all the power players and "contenders to the throne," as had been shown many times before (the kingdom of Tlaxcala would attempt its own power grab in 1519 by using the Spanish as mercenary-allies). By 1519, the Aztec capital, Mexico-Tenochtitlan, was among the largest cities in the world with a population of around 350,000 (although some estimates range as high as 500,000). Beijing at the same time had a population variously estimated to be 670,000 up to one million people. By comparison, the population of London in 1519 was 80,000 people. Tenochtitlan is the site of modern-day Mexico City.Allies of the Aztecs.In the formation of the Triple Alliance empire, the Aztecs established several ally states. Among them were Cholula (the site of an early massacre by Spaniards), Texcoco (the site of a major library, subsequently burned by the Spanish), Tlacopan, and Matatlan. Also, many of the kingdoms conquered by the Aztecs provided soldiers for further imperial campaigns such as: Culhuacan, Xochimilco, Tepeacac, Amecameca, Coaixtlahuacan, Cuetlachtlan, Ahuilizipan. The Aztec war machine would become multi-ethnic, comprising soldiers from conquered areas, led by a large core of Aztec warriors and officers. This same strategy would later be employed by the Spaniards.Legacy of the Aztecs.The Aztecs left a durable stamp upon modern Mexican culture. Much of what is considered modern Mexican culture derives from the Aztec civilization: place-names, words, food, art, dress, symbols, and even the name "Mexican". ("See also Origin and history of the name "Mexico-Tenochtitlan"").Mexico City as the capital.Today, the Aztec's capital city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan survives in modern times as Mexico City, the capital of the modern nation of Mexico. Mexico City is the largest metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere (and second-largest in the world following Tokyo, Japan). In their haste to colonize, the Spanish initially retained much of the original layout of the city of Tenochtitlan, reflected today in the various city districts ("barrios") and in the central precinct of the Zócalo (formerly the ceremonial center of Tenochtitlan). Many streets and boulevards lay along the same paths as the previous water canals of Tenochtitlan. Several pyramids and ruins have even remain unearthed within the urban sprawl of the city. Over the two centuries following the conquest, the lakes of the valley were drained, drastically changing the landscape. The former island city now was able to spread over a dry plain. Only small remnants of the old canal city remain, such as in the celebrated flower district of Xochimilco. Today, Mexico City incorporates over 25 million people, whereas in 1519, that number was 500 thousand.Food and cuisine.Foods originating from Mexico.Mexico is a Megadiverse country. As such, many ingredients commonly consumed by today's people worldwide originate from Mexico. The names of the various foods are originally from Nahuatl. Examples of such ingredients are: Chocolate, Tomato, Maize and Corn, Vanilla, Avocado, Guava, Chayote, Epazote, Camote, Jícama, Tejocote, Nopal, Huitlacoche, Zapote, Mamey zapote, many varieties of modern Beans.Mexican cuisine.The majority of Mexico's cuisine are of indigenous origins and are based on the ingredients listed above: These foods continue to make up the core of Mexican cuisine today.Nahuatl language.Because the Mexica spoke Nahuatl (the most common language at the time of Spanish arrival) their terms and names were widespread as descriptors of cities, regions, valleys, rivers, mountains, and many cultural objects. The Spanish used Nahuatl translators as they waged wars of conquest throughout Mexico and beyond. As a result, Nahuatl names were used as geographic identifiers as far away as Guatemala and the northern state of Coahuila on the southern Texas border. Numerous words from the Nahuatl language are today interspersed within Mexican Spanish. These words are used to describe geography, foods, colloquialisms, and first names for people (e.g., Xochitl, "flower," for females and Tenoch for males). Today, approximately 1.5 million people continue to speak the Nahuatl language. Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in learning Nahuatl by Spanish-speaking and English-speaking Mexicans at-large. Some Mexican-American activists have portrayed Nahuatl language as a path to claiming an identity that is not European-based or Anglo-derivative (i.e. "Hispanic", "Latino", or "American").Modern flag of Mexico.The official story of Mexico is, the coat of arms of Mexico was inspired by an Aztec legend based on the founding of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs, then a nomadic tribe, were wandering throughout Mexico in search of a sign that would indicate the precise spot on which they would build their capital. Their god Huitzilopochtli had commanded them to find an eagle devouring a snake, perched on top of a cactus that grew on a rock submerged in a lake. After two hundred years of wandering, they found the promised sign on a small island in the swampy lake of Texcoco. It was there they found their new capital, Tenochtitlan, also known as Mexico.Art and symbols.Mexican art has inspired generations of Mexican-descent artists, both inside and outside of Mexico's modern borders. Images of pyramids, the "Aztec calendar", and armed indigenous warriors have been popular themes. Also popular have been zig-zag motifs (found on indigenous buildings and pottery) and the theological notion of The Four Directions (found among indigenous cultures across the Western Hemsiphere). In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the ceremonies and art of the Day of the Dead. The art, architecture, and symbols of the Mexica civilization exert such a unique identity that they are commonly used in advertisements for tourism to Mexico.Urbanization.For much of its history, the majority of Mexico's population lived an urban lifestyle: cities, towns, and villages. Only a fraction of the population was tribal and wandering. Most people were permanently settled, agriculturally based, and identified with an urban identity, as opposed to a tribal identity. Mexico has long been an urbanized land, which was graphically reflected in the writings of the Spaniards who encountered them.</doc>
<doc id="19282469" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19282469" title="Under Our Skin">Under Our SkinUnder Our Skin: The Untold Story of Lyme Disease is a 2008 documentary film about Lyme disease, focusing on the controversy surrounding "chronic Lyme disease", a controversial and unrecognized diagnosis. The film was directed by Andy Abrahams Wilson, who became interested in the subject after his sister contracted Lyme disease. The film had its theatrical premiere on June 19, 2009 at the IFC Center in New York City.Controversial views.The film argues that persistent infection with Lyme disease is responsible for a variety of debilitating symptoms. The film presents advocates of the position, including International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS). The position is at odds with that of major medical bodies including the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Neurology, who do not recognize "chronic" Lyme disease as a legitimate diagnosis. The film portrays the Infectious Diseases Society of America as "an organization riddled with conflicts of interest," and briefly discusses Richard Blumenthal's antitrust charges against the society.Synopsis.The film follows six individuals including major league ball player Ben Petrick who report chronic symptoms, which they attribute to persistent Lyme infection. The majority of the film is devoted to the storyline of these patients and their reported recovery. At the same time, the film presents advocates of long-term therapies for chronic Lyme disease and briefly presents the position of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).The second half of the film focuses primarily on state medical board investigations of Joseph Jemsek and Ray Jones, two physicians who prescribe long-term antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease. Jemsek was investigated based on the complaints of 10 patients who described "nightmarish experiences" as a result of his treatment; he was supported by a number of patients and Lyme disease advocacy organizations. The board found that Jemsek had departed from standard medical practice and had failed to inform patients that his treatments were unorthodox; his medical license was suspended with stay, allowing him to continue practicing medicine. Facing a lawsuit from an insurance company, Jemsek declared bankruptcy and closed his medical practice.The final act of the film focuses on Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal's antitrust investigation of the IDSA Lyme disease guidelines. Blumenthal issued a press release in May 2008 stating that his investigation "uncovered serious flaws" in the development of the IDSA guidelines, although Blumenthal declined to file any charges. Under pressure of mounting legal fees, the IDSA agreed to submit its Lyme disease guidelines to an independent review, which supported the scientific validity of the IDSA guidelines. The case was described in "Forbes" as "intimidation" of the medical community by the Attorney General, and in "JAMA" as an example of "elected officials advocating for health policies against the weight of scientific evidence." The film concludes with vignettes of two patients discussing their recoveries.Critical reception.The "New York Times" described the film as a "polemic" and "inflammatory.""Variety" noted that the film "sides with those advocating unconventional treatments, gives gatekeepers from Infectious Diseases of America [sic, actually Infectious Diseases Society of America their say."According to meta-critic review site Rotten Tomatoes, "Under Our Skin" is certified "fresh". As of January, 2010, the film has received 23 positive reviews and 5 negative reviews for a fresh score of 82%.On November 18, 2009, the Academy Awards announced "Under Our Skin" as one of 15 semi-finalists in the Documentary Feature category from 89 qualifying documentaries.

<doc id="19248693" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19248693" title="Macromolecular crowding">Macromolecular crowdingThe phenomenon of macromolecular crowding alters the properties of molecules in a solution when high concentrations of macromolecules such as proteins are present. Such conditions occur routinely in living cells; for instance, the cytosol of "Escherichia coli" contains about 300– of macromolecules. Crowding occurs since these high concentrations of macromolecules reduce the volume of solvent available for other molecules in the solution, which has the result of increasing their effective concentrations. This crowding effect can make molecules in cells behave in radically different ways than in test-tube assays. Consequently, measurements of the properties of enzymes or processes in metabolism that are made in the laboratory ("in vitro") in dilute solutions may be different by many orders of magnitude from the true values seen in living cells ("in vivo"). The study of biochemical processes under realistically crowded conditions is very important, since these conditions are a ubiquitous property of all cells and crowding may be essential for the efficient operation of metabolism.Cause and effects.The interior of cells is a crowded environment. For example, an "Escherichia coli" cell is only about 2 micrometres (μm) long and 0.5 μm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 μm3. However, "E. coli" can contain up to 4,288 different types of proteins, and about 1,000 of these types are produced at a high enough level to be easily detected. Added to this mix are various forms of RNA and the cell's DNA chromosome, giving a total concentration of macromolecules of between 300 to 400 mg/ml. In eukaryotes the cell's interior is further crowded by the protein filaments that make up the cytoskeleton, this meshwork divides the cytosol into a network of narrow pores.These high concentrations of macromolecules occupy a large proportion of the volume of the cell, which reduces the volume of solvent that is available for other macromolecules. This excluded volume effect increases the effective concentration of macromolecules (increasing their chemical activity), which in turn alters the rates and equilibrium constants of their reactions. In particular this effect alters dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome. Crowding may also affect enzyme reactions involving small molecules if the reaction involves a large change in the shape of the enzyme.The size of the crowding effect depends on both the molecular mass and shape of the molecule involved, although mass seems to be the major factor – with the effect being stronger with larger molecules. Notably, the size of the effect is non-linear, so macromolecules are much more strongly affected than are small molecules such as amino acids or simple sugars. Macromolecular crowding is therefore an effect exerted by large molecules on the properties of other large molecules.Importance.Macromolecular crowding is an important effect in biochemistry and cell biology. For example, the increase in the strength of interactions between proteins and DNA produced by crowding may be of key importance in processes such as transcription and DNA replication. Crowding has also been suggested to be involved in processes as diverse as the aggregation of hemoglobin in sickle-cell disease, and the responses of cells to changes in their volume.The importance of crowding in protein folding is of particular interest in biophysics. Here, the crowding effect can accelerate the folding process, since a compact folded protein will occupy less volume than an unfolded protein chain. However, crowding can reduce the yield of correctly folded protein by increasing protein aggregation. Crowding may also increase the effectiveness of chaperone proteins such as GroEL in the cell, which could counteract this reduction in folding efficiency. It has also been shown that macromolecular crowding affects protein-folding dynamics as well as overall protein shape where distinct conformational changes are accompanied by secondary structure alterations implying that crowding-induced shape changes may be important for protein function and malfunction in vivo.A particularly striking example of the importance of crowding effects involves the crystallins that fill the interior of the lens. These proteins have to remain stable and in solution for the lens to be transparent; precipitation or aggregation of crystallins causes cataracts. Crystallins are present in the lens at extremely high concentrations, over 500 mg/ml, and at these levels crowding effects are very strong. The large crowding effect adds to the thermal stability of the crystallins, increasing their resistance to denaturation. This effect may partly explain the extraordinary resistance shown by the lens to damage caused by high temperatures.Study.Due to macromolecular crowding enzyme assays and biophysical measurements performed in dilute solution may fail to reflect the actual process and its kinetics taking place in the cytosol. One approach to produce more accurate measurements would be to use highly concentrated extracts of cells, to try to maintain the cell contents in a more natural state. However, when using such extracts it is very difficult to study one process in isolation. Consequently, the crowded effects may be mimicked "in vitro" by adding high concentrations of an inert molecule such as polyethylene glycol or ficoll to assays containing purified components. However, using such artificial crowding agents can be complicated, as these crowding molecules can sometimes interact in other ways with the process being examined, such as by binding weakly to one of the components.</doc>

It was carried out by German Empire troops. From August 2 until August 22, 1914 at the beginning of World War I, one of the oldest towns in Poland (then under Russian administration), was shelled, bombed and burned down. The event is also known as the Pogrom of Kalisz or Poland’s Louvain (see "Schrecklichkeit" atrocities).Kalisz was founded in the 13th century on an ancient site encircled by the Prosna river. It has a typical mediaeval urban structure. On February 13, 1793, Kalisz and the Kalisz region were annexed by Prussia during the partition of Poland; but after Napoleon's defeat on the Eastern front, it was taken over by Imperial Russia, which subsequently controlled the city for more than 100 years – from February 14, 1813, until August 2, 1914. The Prussian army invaded Kalisz from the nearby Ostrowo on August 2, 1914. Major Hermann Preusker, the commander of the second battalion of the 155th Infantry Regiment, gave the order to burn down the city. As a result, 95% of Kalisz was completely destroyed. Most of the houses within the mediaeval town area were levelled to the ground. Only churches and public offices survived. A significant number of citizens were shot. After the war, Kalisz which before the war had 65,000 citizens, was left with 5,000 inhabitants following the August exodus.The recovery took years; however, even before the war ended, the Town's Council already decided to rebuild Kalisz in such a way as to reflect its long history. The reconstruction was based on a design which won the 1916 competition, although the German authorities opposed it. After the town was liberated from Germany in 1918 and became part of the reborn sovereign Poland, reconstruction was pursued in an energetic and enthusiastic way.Outbreak of World War I.The Russians pull out.The first inclination of the war reaching Kalisz was when the nearby border with the German Empire was closed at Neu Skalmierschütz and rail movements across the border to Germany were stopped. Russian officials began evacuating the city alongside military personnel. On August 2, 1914, at dawn, the Russian military retreated from the city without fighting, after setting fire to military warehouses near the railway station. It was set on fire as well as the trains and transport wagons. A civic committee was established by the citizens of the town which began to administer the city. Additionally, the Civil Guard was established to keep order, while workers tried to put the fire at the railway station out.The Germans move in.First German soldiers appear.Around 14:00, on August 2, the first German patrols appeared along the railway tracks. As the patrols increased, crowds gathered. Altogether the atmosphere was neutral, some unfavourable comments could be heard from among the citizens of Kalisz. When a German officer arrived, mayor Bukowiński gave him the keys to the city as a symbolic gesture. After ensuring that there were no Russian forces present, the German patrols withdrew to Szczypiorno. In later hours, other German soldiers started to arrive on bicycles. Many of them were Poles from the nearby town of Schildberg, and there was no hostility between them and the local Polish population. The German soldiers of Polish extraction (about 30 in number), quickly separated from the rest of the Germans and went to the market, where they engaged in conversation with the local population and drank beer with them. German soldiers remained separated and struggled to engage in conversations which were carried out in Polish.Arrival of the main German forces.Only on the night of 2 and 3 of August around midnight, did the main German forces come from the Fifth Company of the 155th regiment of infantry in Ostrowo. The commander, Captain Keild, demanded lodgings for his troops and summoned the mayor. On the same night, forces of Major Hermann Preusker came to the city from the 2nd Battalion of infantry. Preusker immediately took over and named himself the commandant. At the selection of quarters, Preusker showed great displeasure and demanded the building housing the Musical Society and Christian Craftsmen in the city instead of the Russian military barracks.At dawn on 3 August, mortars were brought into the city. At the same time, Major Preusker started arguing with the city council, although they had fulfilled his every request. Some believed he was disappointed with the lack of resistance and the indifferent attitude to German soldiers by the Polish population, which had begun to establish personal connections with the ethnic Polish soldiers from the German-controlled part of the partitioned country. Some of those soldiers did not show any support for the war and even condemned the conflict.Executions and repression.In the late evening, a single shot was heard, which began panic and confusion among the city population; it was followed by machine gun fire. After this short event, peace returned to the area. During the night the firing resumed, when German soldiers started to shoot at each other, probably thinking that they were surrounded by Russian forces. Although the civilians stayed at home, 21 of them and six soldiers were dead and 32 soldiers were wounded. Major Preusker claimed that it was the local population that carried out the shooting.On August 4, Preusker took six citizens as hostages, 50,000 rubles of retribution, a curfew, a ban on publishing newspapers, and threatened to take further hostages and executions. Despite this, the Germans continued with further repression and executions. Civilians were brutally beaten, often with rifle butts; at any sign of resistance, people were shoved against a wall and shot. Many executions happened near the hospital where wounded people were taken. Several corpses were left in the street. Pedestrians were mistreated and any signs of opposition were quelled with such brutality and under such conditions that there were cases where soldiers refused to follow the orders of their officers. Up to 20 people were murdered in this way.Shelling and raids into the city.After taking their hostages with them, the Germans started to retreat from the city in late afternoon. An hour later, artillery fire was laid down on the city from nearby hills. It was very efficient as Kalisz is located in a deep valley. Additionally, the Germans had ordered the day before that all citizens should illuminate their homes, which helped in directing the fire. This continued for several days, with the Germans staging short raids into the city. As the shelling started fires, general panic broke out, and even as the Germans threatened to kill anybody escaping, people tried to escape by whatever means they had. Large crowds of panic-stricken people, including children and the elderly with any possessions they could grab, were running from the city, which became almost deserted. On August 5, 10,000 people fled the shelled town. The Germans took additional hostages, mistreating them and even killing some. Only after the intervention of the Catholic Church, were some released and others sent to POW camps in Cottbus in Germany.Massacre of civilian population.As the situation seemed to calm down, new forces from Saxony arrived, while Major Preusker's soldiers were withdrawn. Another incident happened on August 7 on Main Market Square, when a lone horse ran free; as a result, German soldiers started shooting in a disorganised way, which led to the death of some of them. Artillery was positioned within the city and the Germans fired at civilian buildings for over an hour. About 100 civilians died in this incident. The Germans searched for survivors and when they found them, they stabbed them to death with bayonets.During the afternoon, City Hall was set on fire, and officials executed. The Germans retreated and shooting began again, which continued overnight between 7 and 8 August. On Saturday morning, the Germans returned to the city, taking 800 men prisoner and executing 80 of them on a nearby hill. The following day, the Germans started to systematically burn down the city. It is mentioned that in cases where civilians tried to fight the fire, they were murdered by German soldiers.The shootings, murderers, plunder of shops and homes as well as the burning down of the whole city lasted until 22 August, when the last home was set alight on Nowoogrodowska street.The Polish press in all territories of Partitions reported extensively on the event, some calling it "monstrous madness, that is unbelievable". The damage in Kalisz constituted 29,5% of the losses in the entire Congress Poland during World War I. The destruction has been compared to the massacre of Louvain, where a city was destroyed in similar manner by the Germans. Before the war Kalisz had 65,000 citizens; after the war, there were only 5,000 left.</doc>
