proceedings under pre- work choices regimewhether regulation granting power to bring proceedings must be read downwhether regulation granting power to bring proceedings prospective onlyindustrial lawIn this proceeding it is alleged that in and between September and December 2005 the respondents contravened s 170WG of the Workplace Relations Act 1996  by applying duress to some of Zinifex's employees in connection with an Australian Workplace Agreement .Effective from 27 March 2006, the Workplace Relations Act was substantially amended by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 .I shall refer to the Workplace Relations Act in its pre- and post-amendment forms as, respectively, the Old Act and the New Act.Regulations made under the Old Act and the New Act will be similarly designated.The applicant is a workplace inspector appointed under s 167 of the New Act.The respondents say the applicant does not have power to bring this proceeding in respect of contraventions of the Old Act.The following question has been ordered to be heard and determined under O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules before trial and before any other questions:Was the Applicant empowered to make this Application (being the Application dated 6 December 2007, supported by the Statement of Claim dated 6 December 2007)?The applicant relies on the power conferred by reg 2.14 in Ch 7 Pt 2 Div 12 of the New Regulations which provides:Despite the amendments of the pre-reform Act by the Work Choices Act, and the repeal of the pre-reform Regulations, a workplace inspector may, subject to any directions given by the Minister under subsection 167 of the Act: institute, or give evidence in, any proceedings; orconduct, or assist in the conduct of, any prosecution; in respect of an alleged breach of a matter under the pre-reform Act or the pre-reform Regulations.The respondents accept that on its face reg 2.14 would confer power on the applicant to institute the present proceeding.However, the respondents say that: The AWA regime under the Old Act constituted a "private code";The Old Act AWA regime has been preserved by cl 17 of Sch 7 of the New Act;Reg 2.14 conflicts with this preserved private code and must be read down under s 13 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 ;Alternatively, reg 2.14 must be read as having prospective effect only.The basis of the "private code" argument is s 170VVof the Old Act which provided:An eligible court may make an order imposing a penalty on a person who contravenes a penalty provision.An application for an order under subsection  that relates to an AWA or ancillary document may be made by a party to the AWA or ancillary document.In this section: penalty provision means... subsection 170WG ...Section 170WG of the Old Act provided that a person must not apply duress to an employer or employee in connection with an AWA or ancillary document.Regulation 9 of the Old Regulations provided that, subject to subregs  and , an "inspector" (ie an inspector appointed under Pt V of the Old Act) may, subject to any direction of the Minister, inter alia, "institute ... any proceedings... in respect of... a contravention of the Act".However, subreg  provided that inspectors "do not have any powers with respect to breaches of Parts...VID... of the Act".Sections 170VV and 170WG were in Pt VID.The "private code" is said to be preserved by cl 17 of Sch 7 of the New Act which provides:Subject to this Schedule, the following provisions of the pre-reform Act continue to apply in relation to a pre-reform AWA, despite the repeals and amendments made by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 : sections... 170VV...Regulations made under the pre-reform Act, to the extent that they relate to the provisions mentioned in subclause , continue to apply in relation to a pre-reform AWA.Under the Old Act the compliance regime in respect of AWAs was not entirely private.The Employment Advocate was empowered to investigate alleged breaches of AWAs and provide free legal representation to a party in proceedings: s 83BB and .However, to the extent that there was a "private code" under the Old Act, it was a code to be found both in that Act and the regulations made under it.Whatever construction is to be put on "may" in s 170VV, it is the Old Regulations which clearly prevented an inspector from bringing proceedings for a penalty in respect of AWA duress.Note also s 84 of the Old Act which provided that an inspector had such powers and functions "in relation to the observance of this Act... as are conferred by this Act".The expression "this Act" was defined to include the  Regulations: s 4.In that setting, it is understandable that the New Act should provide that the powers of workplace inspectors could be conferred at regulation level.Workplace inspectors under the New Act are in a sense the successors of inspectors under the Old Act but the two offices are quite distinct.Thus s 846 of the New Act confers power on the Governor-General to make regulations in relation to, inter alia, "the manner in which... applications... under this Act may be made and dealt with": s 846.When the New Act and the New Regulations are compared with the Old Act and Old Regulations it will be seen that the supposed conflict between New Act and New Regulations is resolved.The principles that govern the use of regulations in construing the statute under which they are made were stated by Lord Lowry in Hanlon v The Law Society [1981] AC 124 at 193-194 as follows:Subordinate legislation may be used in order to construe the parent Act, but only where power is given to amend the Act by regulations or where the meaning of the Act is ambiguous.Regulations made under the Act provide a Parliamentary or administrative contemporanea expositio of the Act but do not decide or control its meaning: to allow this would be to substitute the rule-making authority for the judges as interpreter and would disregard the possibility that the regulation relied on was misconceived or ultra vires.Regulations which are consistent with a certain interpretation of the Act tend to confirm that interpretation.Where the Act provides a framework built on by contemporaneously prepared regulations, the latter may be a reliable guide to the meaning of the former.The regulations are a clear guide, and may be decisive, when they are made in pursuance of a power to modify the Act, particularly if they come into operation on the same day as the Act which they modify.Clear guidance may also be obtained from regulations which are to have effect as if enacted in the parent Act.Number  is applicable to the present case.In Thorn EMI Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 491 at 498 Beaumont J, in the context of the sales tax legislative scheme, said:It may be accepted, as a general proposition, that "the intention of Parliament in enacting an Act is not to be ascertained by reference to the terms in which a delegated power to legislate has been exercised" (per Brennan J in Webster v McIntosh (1980) 49 FLR 317 at 321.On the other hand, as Mason J observed in the course of argument in Brayson Motors Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1985] HCA 20 ; (1985) 156 CLR 651 at 652: One looks at regulations, not to construe an overall scheme or to throw light on ambiguity in a statutory provision, but to ascertain what the scheme is.In the present context, it has been settled since the decision in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation  v Ellis &amp; Clark Ltd [1934] HCA 54 ; (1934) 52 CLR 85 , that the Sales Tax Regulations are an essential part of the legislative scheme (see, especially, per Dixon J at 89).This approach was affirmed recently in Brayson Motors (supra, at 657) and it is unnecessary to pursue the questions which could arise in other contexts (cf Neill v Glacier Metal Co Ltd [1965] 1 QB 16 at 27; Jackson v Hall [1980] AC 854 at 884, 889; Bennion, opcit, at p 146).In my opinion, reference to the Sales Tax Regulations, including reg 14A, is not merely permissible; it is essential to an understanding of the legislative plan.Contemporaneous regulations have been called in aid in construing an Act in two comparatively recent decisions of the House of Lords: see Government of Canada v Aronson [1990] 1 AC 579 at 610 (per Lord Lowry) and British Amusement Catering Trades Association v Westminster City Council [1989] AC 147 at 158; see also Elazac Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Patents [1994] FCA 1315 ; (1994) 53 FCR 86 at 90.In the Second Reading speech of 2 November 2005 (Australia, House of Representatives, Debates (2005) Vol HR 18, p 22), the Minister, speaking of the Office of Workplace Services, an executive agency in which inspectors were deployed, said that the Officewill have increased powers.These include the power to enforce compliance with the Workplace Relations Act , awards and agreements, the freedom of association provisions and the rules for agreement making.Thus when cl 17 of Sch 7 of the New Act speaks of provisions of the Old Act, including s 170VV "continu to apply" in relation to an Old Act AWA, that is to be read as meaning so much of s 170VV as is consistent with the new scheme under the New Act and New Regulations.The power of an eligible court to impose a penalty (subs ) and the maximum limit of that penalty (subs ) would still apply to contraventions of the Old Act, but not the prohibition on inspectors instituting proceedings by virtue of subs  (if that be its effect) and Old reg 9.That makes sense, because after the New Act came into operation there were no "inspectors" but only "workplace inspectors".There would be no point in prohibiting officials who no longer exist from instituting proceedings.Similar considerations apply to the Old Regulations.The respondents relied on Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402.In that case the High Court held (at 410) that reg 188 of the Excise Regulations 1925  were ultra vires the Excise Act 1901  and void because regulations cannot vary or depart from the positive provisions made by the Act or... go outside the field of operation which the Act marks out for itself.The regulation in question was invalid because it imposed "a distinct and independent addition of liability to the liabilities which the legislature has provided" (at 412).In the present case the respondents eschewed any argument that reg 2.14 was ultra vires and therefore void.The present case is not like Morton where the statute covered the field and left no room for regulations.On the contrary, the scheme of both Old Act and New Act is to leave to the regulations questions of who may enforce.The respondents' alternative argument is that reg 2.14 only operates prospectively.They say that at the time the alleged contraventions took place they had a "right" not to be vexed by litigation by anyone other than a party to an AWA.Citing Rodway v The Queen [1990] HCA 19 ; (1990) 169 CLR 515 at 519, they contended that they had a "right to be free of a claim".They rely also on s 12 of the Legislative Instruments Act .The expression quoted from Rodway appears in a context where their Honours are discussing limitation statutes and whether they should be given a retrospective operation to revive a cause of action which has become barred, or deprive a person of the opportunity of instituting an action which is within time.In such cases, giving the legislation a retrospective operation would operate so as to impair existing, substantive rights --- either the right to be free of a claim or the right to bring a claim --- and such an operation could not be said to be merely procedural.Emphasis added.The actual decision in Rodway does not assist the respondents --- indeed to the contrary.Until its repeal on 26 November 1987, s 136 of the Criminal Code  required corroboration for conviction of certain offences.Before the date of repeal the appellant was charged with such an offence.He was committed for trial in 1988 and his trial commenced in 1989.The High Court (Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ) unanimously held that the Code in its post-amendment form applied.Their Honours said at 521:ordinarily an amendment to the practice or procedure of a court, including the admissibility of evidence and the effect to be given to evidence, will not operate retrospectively so as to impair any existing right.It may govern the way in which the right is to be enforced or vindicated, but that does not bring it within the presumption against retrospectivity.In the present case the respondents in September---December 2005 either did or did not apply duress in relation to AWAs.If they did, they incurred a substantive obligation, the liability to such penalty as might be fixed by a court.They did not acquire any substantive right to have that obligation ascertained in some particular way, or only at the suit of some particular person or class of persons, any more than they acquired the right to be tried only by the law of evidence as it stood in December 2005.For the same reason, the respondents acquired no "rights" in terms of the Legislative Instruments Act .In any event, the presumption against retrospectivity is no more than that, a presumption which must yield to a clear expression of intent to the contrary.An issue of retrospectivity raises the question whether a law which on its face applies equally to past and future events must be read down as to apply only to the latter.In its terms reg 2.14 is solely concerned with involvement in proceedings for alleged contraventions under the Old Act.Such contraventions can only have happened before reg 2.14 came into operation.The whole purpose of reg 2.14 is to deal with past events.The question will be answered: Yes.The proceeding will be adjourned for further directions on a date to be fixed.Costs are reserved.</doc>

New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (No 1) (1985) 9 FCR 442 at 444 per Toohey J.The discretion is unfettered.In particular, although Order 28 rule 3 of the Federal Court Rules 1976  ("the Rules") refers to matters the Court may take into account when considering an application for an order for security for costs under s 56 of the Act , it is clear that the rule is not intended to be an exhaustive statement of the factors the Court may consider, nor does the rule limit the power of the Court under s 56 of the Act : Bell Wholesale Co Ltd v Gates Export Corp (No 2) (1984) 2 FCR 1 at 3.Under O 28 r 3 of the Rules, the Court may take into account:that an applicant is ordinarily resident outside Australia; that an applicant is suing, not for the applicant's own benefit, but for the benefit of some other person and the Court has reason to believe that the applicant will be unable to pay the costs of the respondent if ordered to do so; subject to subrule , that the address of the applicant is not stated or is incorrectly stated in the originating process;Sub-rule  provides that: The Court shall not order an applicant to give security by reason only of paragraph   if it appears to the Court that the failure to state his address or the mis-statement of his address was made without intention to deceive.In KP Cable Investments Pty Ltd v Meltglow Pty Ltd (1995) 56 FCR 189 at 197-198 Beazley J set out some relevant considerations.These are: That such applications should be brought promptly.That regard is to be had to the strength and bona fides of the applicant's case.Whether the applicant's impecuniosity was caused by the respondent's conduct subject of the claim.Whether the respondent's application for security is oppressive.Whether there are any persons standing behind the company who are likely to benefit from the litigation and who are willing to provide the necessary security.Whether persons standing behind the company have offered any personal undertaking to be liable for the costs.Is the party against whom security is sought in substance a plaintiff.In PS Chellaram &amp; Co Ltd v China Ocean Shipping Co [1991] HCA 36 ; (1991) 102 ALR 321 McHugh J stated at 323:the fact that a party, bringing proceedings, is resident out of the jurisdiction and has no assets within the jurisdiction has been seen as a circumstance of great weight in determining whether an order for security for costs should be made.Indeed, for many years the practice has been to order such a party to provide security for costs unless that party can point to other circumstances which overcome the weight of the circumstance that that person is resident out of and has no assets within the jurisdiction.This "well-established" principle was cited by Besanko J in Cheng XI Shipyard v The Ship "Falcon Trident" [2006] FCA 759 at [9] .In that case, Besanko J ordered that security be given.His Honour concluded that although the applicant had a strong claim that it would obtain a judgment in its favour, this was not sufficient to outweigh the fact that the applicant was not resident in the jurisdiction and had no assets in the jurisdiction.The basis for the respondents' concern is that: the applicants are ordinarily resident outside of Australia and do not have any property in this jurisdiction; the proceedings may have been instituted, or are being conducted for the benefit of another, namely Showgold Pty Ltd.Applicants ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction The applicants concede that they are ordinarily resident outside of the jurisdiction of Western Australia.I am satisfied that this concession was soundly based in the evidence before me.In Energy Drilling, Gummow J stated at p 50,422: The purpose of ordering security for costs against an applicant ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction is to ensure that a successful respondent will have a fund available within the jurisdiction of this Court against which it can enforce the judgment for costs, so that the respondent does not bear the risk as to the certainty of enforcement in the foreign country and as to the time and complexity of the action there which might be necessary to effect enforcement: Kent Heating Ltd v Cook-on-Gas Products Pty Ltd (1984) 59 ALR 277 at 279.On the other hand, the mere circumstance that an applicant is resident outside the jurisdiction does not necessarily invite an exercise of discretion in favour of ordering security, the question being how justice will best be served in the particular case: Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs [1984] FCA 89 ; (1984) 2 FCR 463 ; CBS Records Australia Ltd v Telmak Teleproducts (Aust) Pty Ltd (1987) 72 ALR 270 at 284-285.A person who is ordinarily resident outside of the jurisdiction but who has real or personal property inside the jurisdiction may avoid an order to give security for costs.The property must, however, be available to meet an order for costs.The principle question informing the exercise of my discretion is, accordingly, whether the applicants have property available to meet an order for costs.Assets within the jurisdiction?The applicants submit that for the reasons which follow, there is an adequate 'fund' available in Australia against which the respondents, if successful, can enforce an order for costs.This submission picks up the language of Gummow J in Energy Drilling to which I have referred.The first and second applicants together own 25 shares in the first respondent ("Awap"), whose sole business concerns the ownership and leasing of 'International House', a building on St Georges Terrace, Perth.On the applicants' case, the first and second applicants own half of the issued shares in Awap.On the respondents' case, they own one third.International House was recently valued at $50 million dollars.It has associated debt of approximately $28 million and generates a net rental income of $3.28 million per annum.Awap's interest payments on its borrowings amount to approximately $2.47 million per year and it currently holds $688,000 on deposit with the Bendigo Bank.The applicants submit that Awap has substantial cash flow and a favourable debt to equity ratio.Awap, accordingly, generates more than $800,000 in gross profit.The lease which produces this profit does not expire for at least 7 years and there is no reason, therefore, why it should not continue to generate profits of this order on an annual basis.The first and second applicants hold shares in a company that could comfortably issue a dividend to its shareholders in excess of $400,000 based on a single year's profits.In the event that the applicants are unsuccessful in these proceedings, the second, third and possibly the fourth respondents will control the board of directors of Awap.If the applicants do not pay a costs order against them (estimated by the respondents to be of the order of $130,000), the relevant respondents can cause Awap to declare and pay a dividend to its shareholders such that the first and second applicants' share of that dividend would be sufficient to cover any costs order.On the respondents' case regarding the first and second applicants' shareholding, a dividend of $390,000 would cover the estimated costs.On the applicants case, a dividend of around $260,000 would be sufficient.Once the dividend has been declared, it is a debt owed to the first and second applicants by Awap and is therefore an "available debt" as that term is defined in s 46 of the Civil Judgment Enforcement Act 2004  ("CJE Act"), which can be appropriated for the purposes of enforcement under s 49 of the CJE Act.Pursuant to s 49 of the CJE Act, the Court may make an order that the dividend issued to the first and second applicants be paid to the respondents to satisfy the costs order.However, the respondents submit and I accept, that the first and second applicants, as shareholders in Awap, have no entitlement to be paid dividends from Awap's profits.Pursuant to Articles 123 and 126 of AWAP's Articles of Association, its directors have a discretion as to whether dividends are declared.It cannot be presumed that dividends in a sufficient amount, or at all, will be declared.Awap, by its directors, may determine to employ its profits in its present and or other business activities.I do not regard the mere possibility that the first and second applicants will be the beneficiaries of dividends as amounting to them presently having assets within the jurisdiction.The respondents do not have other realisable assets in Australia which would be available to satisfy an order to pay the respondents' costs.The respondents have conducted relevant searches which have disclosed that none of the applicants is the registered proprietor of any real property in Western Australia.It is not suggested however, that the personal applicants are impecunious.The enforceability of an Australian judgment against the applicants The applicants then submit that, upon the authority of Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs [1984] FCA 89 ; (1984) 2 FCR 463 security ought not be ordered.In Barton (at 468) Morling J said that "the court has a discretion to refuse to make an order for security for the payment of costs even if an applicant is ordinarily resident outside Australia".His Honour considered that the historical basis for an order for security for costs did not apply because if the defendant were successful it could rely on the UK legislation, ( Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933  s 2) which allowed for the enforcement of Australian judgments, upon registration.On that basis, security for costs was ordered but limited to the sum of $2,000, being an estimate of the cost of registering the judgment, in the UK, for enforcement.The applicants submit that these proceedings are similar to Barton in that an Australian judgment, upon registration in Singapore, can be enforced there pursuant to the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Chapter 265) (1921) (Sing.).Further, there would be even less inconvenience for the Respondents than in Barton , since the third respondent (who is a director of the other respondents) is also a Singapore resident and the respondents retain Singapore lawyers to instruct Australian lawyers in this proceeding and for other purposes.Section 5 in Part 2 of the Foreign Judgments Act 1991  (" Foreign Judgments Act ") provides:If the Governor-General is satisfied that, in the event of the benefits conferred by this Part being applied to money judgments given in the superior courts of a country, substantial reciprocity of treatment will be assured in relation to the enforcement in that country of money judgments given in all Australian superior courts, the regulations may provide that this Part extends in relation to that country.Regulation 3 and the Schedule to the Foreign Judgments Regulations 1992  provide that the Republic of Singapore is a country to which Part 2 of the Act is extended.Regulation 4 and the Schedule provide that the Supreme Court of Singapore (consisting of the Court of Appeal and the High Court) is a superior court for the purpose of the Foreign Judgments Act .In Farmitalia Carlo Erba Srl v Delta West Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 950 ; (1994) 28 IPR 336 at p 342, Heerey J having first considered Barton stated that merely showing, without more, that the relevant party was ordinarily resident in one of the countries listed in the Foreign Judgments Regulations was insufficient to meet the prima facie case established for the application of Order 28 rule 3.To conclude otherwise, his Honour observed, would amount to treating the Foreign Judgments Act or the Foreign Judgments Regulations as an amendment sub silentio of Order 28 rule 3 of the Rules.In that case there was no evidence that the applicant had assets available in Italy or in some other country or countries or, if it did, that an Australian judgment would be enforceable in such other country or countries.Such is the position here should, in due course, any judgment for costs against the applicants be registered in Singapore or elsewhere.There is no evidence that the applicants have any assets in Singapore or elsewhere amenable to execution upon an Australian judgment which, in due course, might be registered there.Weinberg J referred to Farmitalia with apparent approval in Logue v Hansen Technologies [2003] FCA 81 ; (2003) 125 FCR 590 at [40] .I, also, respectfully agree with the view expressed by Heerey J.These findings are sufficient to dispose of the application in favour of the respondents and it is not necessary accordingly to deal with the other grounds relied upon, in argument, by them.CONCLUSION In my opinion, security ought be ordered.The applicants have not identified any circumstances to overcome the weight of their concession that they are ordinarily resident outside the jurisdiction allied with my finding that they have no assets within the jurisdiction: P.S.Chellaram at p 323.The second, third and fourth respondents' estimated party and party professional costs and outlays up to the provision of discovery by each of the parties, are contained in a draft bill annexed to Ms Tan's affidavit sworn 20 March 2008.The draft bill estimates that those costs will be in the vicinity of $128,870.60.This is the kind of evidence contemplated in Soh v Commonwealth (2006) ALR 425 at [30].This estimate was not called into question by the applicants.Nonetheless the matter is of a discretionary nature.In Farmitalia at p 345-346 Heerey J identified a non-exhaustive list of relevant considerations.I have in the course of these reasons traversed some of these.The consideration that the case might settle without coming to trial is largely met by the fact that security is presently sought only to the discovery stage.Some of the costs referred to concern the cross-claim.The estimated costs therefore are not entirely defensive in character.Furthermore, a taxing officer might award less than is asked.For these reasons I would apply a discount.Security should be ordered in the amount of $115,000.The proceeding should be stayed until such security is provided.Security should be by way of an Australia Bank guarantee or bond, to be provided within 28 days, in a form acceptable to the respondents or fixed by the Court, for the costs of and incidental to this proceeding up to the provision of discovery including inspection.There will be liberty to apply.The applicants should pay the respondents' costs of the application.</doc>
<doc id="19320573" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19320573" title="Destruction of Kalisz">Destruction of KaliszThe destruction and sacking of the city of Kalisz () occurred in August 1914. It was carried out by German Empire troops. From August 2 until August 22, 1914 at the beginning of World War I, one of the oldest towns in Poland (then under Russian administration), was shelled, bombed and burned down. The event is also known as the Pogrom of Kalisz or Poland’s Louvain (see "Schrecklichkeit" atrocities).Kalisz was founded in the 13th century on an ancient site encircled by the Prosna river. It has a typical mediaeval urban structure. On February 13, 1793, Kalisz and the Kalisz region were annexed by Prussia during the partition of Poland; but after Napoleon's defeat on the Eastern front, it was taken over by Imperial Russia, which subsequently controlled the city for more than 100 years – from February 14, 1813, until August 2, 1914. The Prussian army invaded Kalisz from the nearby Ostrowo on August 2, 1914. Major Hermann Preusker, the commander of the second battalion of the 155th Infantry Regiment, gave the order to burn down the city. As a result, 95% of Kalisz was completely destroyed. Most of the houses within the mediaeval town area were levelled to the ground. Only churches and public offices survived. A significant number of citizens were shot. After the war, Kalisz which before the war had 65,000 citizens, was left with 5,000 inhabitants following the August exodus.The recovery took years; however, even before the war ended, the Town's Council already decided to rebuild Kalisz in such a way as to reflect its long history. The reconstruction was based on a design which won the 1916 competition, although the German authorities opposed it. After the town was liberated from Germany in 1918 and became part of the reborn sovereign Poland, reconstruction was pursued in an energetic and enthusiastic way.Outbreak of World War I.The Russians pull out.The first inclination of the war reaching Kalisz was when the nearby border with the German Empire was closed at Neu Skalmierschütz and rail movements across the border to Germany were stopped. Russian officials began evacuating the city alongside military personnel. On August 2, 1914, at dawn, the Russian military retreated from the city without fighting, after setting fire to military warehouses near the railway station. It was set on fire as well as the trains and transport wagons. A civic committee was established by the citizens of the town which began to administer the city. Additionally, the Civil Guard was established to keep order, while workers tried to put the fire at the railway station out.The Germans move in.First German soldiers appear.Around 14:00, on August 2, the first German patrols appeared along the railway tracks. As the patrols increased, crowds gathered. Altogether the atmosphere was neutral, some unfavourable comments could be heard from among the citizens of Kalisz. When a German officer arrived, mayor Bukowiński gave him the keys to the city as a symbolic gesture. After ensuring that there were no Russian forces present, the German patrols withdrew to Szczypiorno. In later hours, other German soldiers started to arrive on bicycles. Many of them were Poles from the nearby town of Schildberg, and there was no hostility between them and the local Polish population. The German soldiers of Polish extraction (about 30 in number), quickly separated from the rest of the Germans and went to the market, where they engaged in conversation with the local population and drank beer with them. German soldiers remained separated and struggled to engage in conversations which were carried out in Polish.Arrival of the main German forces.Only on the night of 2 and 3 of August around midnight, did the main German forces come from the Fifth Company of the 155th regiment of infantry in Ostrowo. The commander, Captain Keild, demanded lodgings for his troops and summoned the mayor. On the same night, forces of Major Hermann Preusker came to the city from the 2nd Battalion of infantry. Preusker immediately took over and named himself the commandant. At the selection of quarters, Preusker showed great displeasure and demanded the building housing the Musical Society and Christian Craftsmen in the city instead of the Russian military barracks.At dawn on 3 August, mortars were brought into the city. At the same time, Major Preusker started arguing with the city council, although they had fulfilled his every request. Some believed he was disappointed with the lack of resistance and the indifferent attitude to German soldiers by the Polish population, which had begun to establish personal connections with the ethnic Polish soldiers from the German-controlled part of the partitioned country. Some of those soldiers did not show any support for the war and even condemned the conflict.Executions and repression.In the late evening, a single shot was heard, which began panic and confusion among the city population; it was followed by machine gun fire. After this short event, peace returned to the area. During the night the firing resumed, when German soldiers started to shoot at each other, probably thinking that they were surrounded by Russian forces. Although the civilians stayed at home, 21 of them and six soldiers were dead and 32 soldiers were wounded. Major Preusker claimed that it was the local population that carried out the shooting.On August 4, Preusker took six citizens as hostages, 50,000 rubles of retribution, a curfew, a ban on publishing newspapers, and threatened to take further hostages and executions. Despite this, the Germans continued with further repression and executions. Civilians were brutally beaten, often with rifle butts; at any sign of resistance, people were shoved against a wall and shot. Many executions happened near the hospital where wounded people were taken. Several corpses were left in the street. Pedestrians were mistreated and any signs of opposition were quelled with such brutality and under such conditions that there were cases where soldiers refused to follow the orders of their officers. Up to 20 people were murdered in this way.Shelling and raids into the city.After taking their hostages with them, the Germans started to retreat from the city in late afternoon. An hour later, artillery fire was laid down on the city from nearby hills. It was very efficient as Kalisz is located in a deep valley. Additionally, the Germans had ordered the day before that all citizens should illuminate their homes, which helped in directing the fire. This continued for several days, with the Germans staging short raids into the city. As the shelling started fires, general panic broke out, and even as the Germans threatened to kill anybody escaping, people tried to escape by whatever means they had. Large crowds of panic-stricken people, including children and the elderly with any possessions they could grab, were running from the city, which became almost deserted. On August 5, 10,000 people fled the shelled town. The Germans took additional hostages, mistreating them and even killing some. Only after the intervention of the Catholic Church, were some released and others sent to POW camps in Cottbus in Germany.Massacre of civilian population.As the situation seemed to calm down, new forces from Saxony arrived, while Major Preusker's soldiers were withdrawn. Another incident happened on August 7 on Main Market Square, when a lone horse ran free; as a result, German soldiers started shooting in a disorganised way, which led to the death of some of them. Artillery was positioned within the city and the Germans fired at civilian buildings for over an hour. About 100 civilians died in this incident. The Germans searched for survivors and when they found them, they stabbed them to death with bayonets.During the afternoon, City Hall was set on fire, and officials executed. The Germans retreated and shooting began again, which continued overnight between 7 and 8 August. On Saturday morning, the Germans returned to the city, taking 800 men prisoner and executing 80 of them on a nearby hill. The following day, the Germans started to systematically burn down the city. It is mentioned that in cases where civilians tried to fight the fire, they were murdered by German soldiers.The shootings, murderers, plunder of shops and homes as well as the burning down of the whole city lasted until 22 August, when the last home was set alight on Nowoogrodowska street.The Polish press in all territories of Partitions reported extensively on the event, some calling it "monstrous madness, that is unbelievable". The damage in Kalisz constituted 29,5% of the losses in the entire Congress Poland during World War I. The destruction has been compared to the massacre of Louvain, where a city was destroyed in similar manner by the Germans. Before the war Kalisz had 65,000 citizens; after the war, there were only 5,000 left.</doc>
